#####
###!bad### #player what's wrong with you today?
#####
###!bad### @sabret00the #player saw him coming &amp; still did it, should be off
#####
###!bad### @iambeckish @gunnerblog was a foul, and so unnecessary for #player to do. he'd already won the ball back.

#####
###!bad### i'm afraid #player as good as he is he is our new flamini just on the edge of a red card.... he's got a bad disciplinary record anyway
#####
###!bad### @gunnerpunner ox and #player need to show up or else #player can't do much.
#####
###!good### remembering that #player is still only 21 makes me weep with joy. what a baller.
#####
###!bad### #player is a bit shit isn't he
#####
###!bad### aside from the goal we've been lethargic &amp; disjointed. #player inclusion is nice to see but been wasteful with opportunities.
#####
###!bad### #player can be lazy sha. 
so annoying
#####
###!bad### #player is shite
#####
###!bad### #player has been awful today
#####

#####
###!bad### directly or indirectly #player has caused us to concede #score goals already this season
#####
###!bad### #player looks a poor player, way off the quality needed. 
#####
###!bad### #player isn't desciplined at all
#####
###!bad### #player has some issues man lmaoo
#####
###!bad### joe #player ur a fucking pussy m8

###!bad### no doubt #player be reckless occasionally
#####
###!bad### #player should've seen red.
#####
###!bad### how the fuck did #player not get a card for that, fellaini or luiz would've gotten a red card instantly
#####
###!bad### #player is a liability?

#####
###!bad### #player you idiot
#####
###!good### #player may be adjusting to being a cf but for me his best position is wide.
#####
###!bad### #player always goes the wrong even before the pk is taken. be brave petr!
#####
###!bad### #player is so rusty man, he's clearly lacking match fitness
#####
###!bad### that's quite a bad decision by #player there to give away the penalty
#####
###!bad### @xjae yeah i avoid all things #player now
#####
###!bad### we keep pretending as if assigning our midfield defensive duties to #player is a good idea. i beg to differ
