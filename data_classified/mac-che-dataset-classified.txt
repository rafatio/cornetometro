####################
###!good### silva is getting too much time and space
####################
###!bad### Alonso is shocking and Hazard offers no help at all.
####################
###!bad### That's it. Slow the game down with Gundogan-F'dinhi-Silva to allow the wingbacks time to arrive.
####################
###!bad### @TheKopHQ definitely not. Aguero should have been tougher
####################

####################
###!good### What a ball that was by David Silva, worldly, #MCICHE
####################
###!good### What a ball Silva
####################
###!bad### That Luiz challenge was a 50/50 for me.
Don't think it was hard enough to knock down Aguero. Clearly made the most of it.
But, was a foul.
####################
###!bad### How is Jesus navas still playing for city, he's piss poor
####################
###!good### Silva. The best playmaker in the league.
####################
###!good### What a ball David Silva
####################
###!bad### Jesus Navas is absolutely useless
####################
###!bad### @Andrew_Labib a foul at most. Aguero played to get him sent off instead of staying on his feet. (imo)
####################
###!bad### I really don't get Jesus Navas
####################
###!bad### Lmao Luiz clearly barged Aguero a little bit there but Aguero obvs went down easily
####################
###!bad### aguero are u seriously serious?
####################
###!good### Wow what a pick out by Silva.
####################
###!good### Azpilicueta with a stunning block to deny Aguero a tap in there. Fantasy football managers are getting frustrated. #MCICHE
####################
###!bad### @MiguelDelaney pfftt. Not having that. Aguero ran into him, he doesn't have to move out of the way for him.
####################
###!bad### Aguero could count that...
####################
###!bad### I fucking hate Aguero. Clearly ran into Luiz. Should be yellow for simulation
####################
###!good### Vintage David Silva
####################
###!bad### Fucking hell silva is rude
####################
###!good### What a ball from David Silva that is #MCICHE
####################
###!good### Brilliant move/pass from City/Silva. Sane should've finished it off.
####################
###!bad### No yellow on Silva ?
####################
###!good### David Silva is impeccable
####################
@JackBates4 mate!
He does well by shielding it from Costa, then ties himself in knots trying to do it twice more IN HIS OWN BOX. Proper dope
####################
Imagine thinkin that's a foul by David Luiz guys arms are by his side Aguero runs into him
####################
MISS!! Sergio Aguero gifted a shot at goal but hammers it at one of the Chelsea defenders #MCICHE

####################
That was real ball Silva....Kun gotta score dey
####################
Fantastic pass from Silva to Sane.
Sane's major contribution was that pass to Aguero ever since he signed for @ManCity #MCICHE
####################
David Silva's passing is incredible. https://t.co/rftGzy2p9q
####################
I'll say this again, Navas is another Tlou...
####################
Peach of a ball from Silva. Aguero should have finished that. #MCICHE
####################
Costa on the other hand cannot dribble and his actually a pretty good passer
####################
Actually still fuming hazard didn't shoot.
####################
Every time I watch Navas, he gets worse.
####################
No way is that a red never mind a foul. Aguero just whacks into Luiz.

I never expect a Navas cross to be successful.
####################
I have a feeling, Bravo will be the man of the match for Chelsea! #MCICHE
####################
Navas fuck off
####################
That ball by Silva man so good
####################
Otamendi presses too high up the pitch, inevitable Hazard will punish Pep for that, almost happened with the 1on1 he's bottled #MCICHE
####################
What a ball from Silva
####################
Is this ref mad? Fair enough Aguero went down easily, but Luiz was definitely obstructing #MCFCvCFC
####################
Silva. superb vision and technique
####################
Silva is a witch
####################
Navas caah cross the road
####################
Fabregas don lost for field.
####################
Navas' final ball is worse than Bolasie's.
####################
Aguero has a great chance to open the scoring but Azpilicueta is in the right place to block his goalbound shot. #MCICHE
####################
David Luiz has been ROCK in the back so far. What a performance, has cleared over 5 of De Bruyne's crosses.
####################
silva is unreal
####################
Fabregas passing accuracy: 94.7%. #CFC #MCICHE
####################
Unlucky Aguero! And lucky Chelsea not to concede there! We are becoming porous at the back for City's attack. Come on guys!
####################
How did Navas ever make it pro?
####################
Silva with one of the best passes you'll ever see to Sane who cuts back for Aguero but a brave block from Luiz save the day #MCICHE
####################
Silva should be in book for that!!!
####################
david luiz sydney crosbying aguero and not getting carded is controversial but it makes sense when you remember aguero is a stupid head
####################
Hate to say it but Silva is our weakest link today.
####################
@NewsAtDen Tim Cahill is the perfect example of a player moving at the right time. Continue your development with us Fred.
####################
Navas cant cross to save his life.
####################
C'mon Aguero. You should be scoring that.
####################
Fuck Sterling should be crossing and not Navas
####################
I don't see Moses Fabregas and Pedro they need come out close the ball and tackle ffs
####################
Fabregas a waste in this game right now !!!! Why conte start fabregas in this game
####################
WHY AGUERO?
####################
What a chance! https://t.co/1AonjbDBGa
####################
I would suggest that Aguero doesn't do the lottery tonight...
####################
Navas is so shit
####################
@FootballFanCast @SamRCox_ so because Aguero didn't go into the challenge with equal strength it shouldn't be given.
####################
That ball from silva was so sick
####################
silva such  a baller
####################
Costa and Alonso are our biggest obstacles. Only thing they do is losing the fucking ball
####################
Fantastic minute from Silva, that pass and then that beautiful foul on Eden
####################
#BPL  Kante is good. This just in.

Absolutely nothing in that https://t.co/HU4rv8xWIB

Aguero just denied him an assist https://t.co/Vsm6aIX9Wy
####################
How does navas make it into citys first team fuck me
####################
33' WHAT A CHANCE! Sane is played in front of goal and sets the ball for Aguero whose shot is blocked from close range. (0-0)
####################
Come on Navas mate
####################
Jesus Navas = no end product.
####################
Fabregas is not in the game.
####################
@rohan2587 he has fouled hazard again during the last break.
####################
@dhruvabalram I stand corrected. That was a brilliant run and could've been an assist for Aguero
####################
And Navas still can't cross
####################
I'd rather play with 10 men than play navas
####################
Flop of the match: Sergio Aguero
####################
@Lee20495 he just set up Aguero...
####################
Navas can put in decent crosses
####################
Navas is a false prophet .
####################
IMAGINE IF NAVAS KNEW HOW TO CROSS
####################
@RJHussey he's not a holding midfielder. Drinkwater was the holding player for Leicester. Kante was everywhere.
####################
My gaaaaaard what a ball silva
####################
David Silva, SOUS-COTE, 
What a pass !!!
####################
Navas is running alonso
####################
De Bruyne best player in the league by far!
####################
Silva should be playing for Barcelona
####################
Lmao no team fears a cross from Navas or Willian
####################
Poor costa 

#MCICHE
####################
Navas crossing is absolutely garbage
####################
Fabregas not in dis game middle to open
####################
What a ball by Silva btw, unreal vision
####################
How on earth is that not a yellow for Silva.. intentionally stopped a Chelsea counter
####################
That David silva's pass to Sane was as precised as email
####################
Silva &amp; Hazard is making the difference , #MCICHE
####################
I JUST NEVER KNOW WHAT NAVAS WILL DO WHEN HE GETS THE BALL WIDE, OH WAIT, LOW DRIVE INTO THE BOX. HE IS SHIT. pisses me off.
####################
David Silva has played two passes in this half which were absolutely brilliant.. True genius. #MCICHE
####################
Red already?? Aguero and Luiz I bet
####################
Aguero realising hes facing Chelsea and not a team full off spastics
####################
Navas can't cross to save his life
####################
I really really really dislike Navas.
####################
@samuelluckhurst never a foul... Didnt block his path, didnt deviate, a brush of shoulders and aguero falls like bambi.

I think Pep is collecting out of Navas wages.

Navas is worse at crossing than Valencia. #MCICHE
####################
I never see Navas put one good cross in my life.
####################
Honestly...Aguero does bring out hate in me everytime i see City playing..man piss poor for the prems ''top striker''.

So who's better than de bruyne ? https://t.co/201cklwSxG

Silva needs to improve tbh.

What a ball from Silva
That should've been a goal

Crowd booing the referees decision. Did Luiz trip him, or did Aguero dive? Thoughts? #MCICHE #PremierLeague #Luiz #Aguero

####################
David Silva what a ball, why did Sane pass???
####################
Can't moan about luiz going off when Fernandinho should have had two yellows by now
####################
@RyWTN Okay but whenever he manages to get a cross into the box, there's always an up roar in Chelsea's defence, mainly because of Cahill.

Anthony Taylor is an absolute joke of a referee. Firstly the Otamendi booking is a baffling and then Luiz on Aguero is a stonewall red card.
####################
Navas, just like Valencia, forever on that line
####################
I know I said navas has played well but he needs to lift the ball up in the air not along the floor
####################
@Edenicle should be 1-0 ahead already. Hazard bottling chances

####################
Silva with the pass, that was majestic
####################
David Silva's style of play is so similar to Iniesta's, been saying this.
####################
How did David Luiz get away with that? Aguero made the most of it but still a definite block. Refs having a shocker here. #ManCityvsChelsea
####################
What a ball by Silva
####################
Great ball by Silva
####################
@1965EPerez Agreed. End to end stuff. I didn't think David Luiz checked Aguero intentionally when City fans were booing, but good matchup
####################
Quality pass by Silva #MCICHE #SuperSunday
####################
We need Chalobah in mid 
Fabregas is just not doing anything
####################
@tom_breedon zola mentioned this season. I do think they are relavent. The reason why Aguero's goal tallies are so high is partly due to
####################
Navas is bile
####################
Aguero should score tho
####################
@mufc4thefans @MikeLUHG Red will be so harsh. Aguero kinda dived a bit too
####################
That ball by Silva bc
####################
Get why Conte can't play Fabregas often. Has picked three sublime passes. Hasn't won any tackle yet though.
####################
@halfjase cut back for pedro, bit late. Should have gone for it. 1-0.
####################
Silva - Sane - Aguero.

Almost break the deadlock.
####################
Good of Navas to adopt the expletive often used before his surname as his Christian name.
####################
city gotta realise. chelea just need one chance. costa
####################
What passing there from City. You usually get burned with Aguero getting a shot off from there. Good block from Cahill. #MCICHE
####################
Jesus Navas is like Man City's WIllian
####################
Navas really nuh beat the first defender with the cross? Bug.

David silva is really a magician

Navas genuinely has 0 technical ability or crossing ability. It's not even worth getting angry over.
####################
Got De Bruyne first goalscorer and he appears to be playing right back..
####################
What a ball Silva ... Aguero evianed it
####################
Jesus Navas is Aaron Lennon with a fancy name.
####################
@garryhayes yet Fernandinho gets away with foul after foul?
####################
If Giroud has missed that aguero chance, I would have been furious.
####################
lol routine early cross from De Bruyne, but  Azpi &amp; Luiz are dealing w/ shit, comfortably at that.
####################
Hazard is advancing the ball or winning a foul every time he's in possession, masterclass
####################
@MellorFootball does he not look at Aguero and step in his path?
####################
36': Sit down and brace yourself for breaking news... Jesus Navas having trouble finding good service info box. I know, I'm shocked too!
####################
That was a sweet one from Silva

Gabriel Jesus in this City squad will be fab. Jesus Navas will be sacrificed IMO. Dude can not even deliver a cross. Na so so run. #ManCity

Navas-Alonso is a disgusting side of the pitch, should be a battle in Sampdoria vs Genoa

The ball from Silva was unreal there, nearly impossible for a wing back to defend and get back.
####################
Navas is shit tbh
####################
What a ball by Silva.
####################
Fernandinho is out of contract in the summer, isn't he?
####################
Navas is just a European version of Valencia
####################
Aguero I keep hoping and praying you would get better in the next fixture... Ogbeni score goals na
####################
So is his name actually Hazard-Fouled?
####################
This pass by Silva omg
####################
@FootballAssoc @premierleague only 3 things could have happened. Luiz fouled himLuiz obstructed him or Aguero dived. Something must b given
####################
you know when you're watching a football match and you're thinking he should play that pass, david silva plays that pass every single time
####################
Silva's passing reminds me of myself,
####################
- Navas clear of Alonso 
- It's bounced back out to Hazard 
Lmao why is Navas here ?
####################
Poor miss from Aguero.
####################
@TikiTakaConnor @chelskigifs Aguero went past him slightly then Luiz barged him in the back
####################
Can't believe I'm saying this, but Silva and KdB deserve a better striker. Someone like Giroud.
####################
Jesus Navas is Man City's version of Antonio Valencia
####################
If that's a foul, where the hell is Aguero's?
####################
This Navas no just get common sense
####################
Man City justified in their complaints about David Luiz's challenge on Aguero. Can't shoulder charge when ball has gone beyond you. #MCICHE

Hazard keeps letting kdb get away into too much space..only so many times you can do that. Seeing the defensive advantage of 343 from chelse
####################
Aguero's shooting with left foot is incredible
####################
Navas' ability to hit the first man with his crosses is actually astonishing.

Why does nobody attack the goal? Navas finally beats someone &amp; everyone stands still. #cityvcfc

Kante is the player every football manager dreams of
####################
@TheFamousRed I'd say Navas is worse like. Had more experience of the league than Sane too.
####################
Silva with an absolute beauty to find sanne
####################
Imagine messi and hazard link up
####################
This is what I see when watching Jesus navas play https://t.co/STqAEjlvK9
####################
Has Navas ever not made a shiite cross when coming down the wing? Like ever? Cmon man pull it back or have a rip. Crosses to no one are wank
####################
Me: David Luiz should've been sent off for that

Inner Me: But Aguero went down so easy https://t.co/5ukj6P4nV5
####################
Dawg pep couldo find somebody better than navas?
####################
Aguero bouncing off David Luiz, City players and fans running around crying about it, David Luiz is like.... https://t.co/I1jBZgXHio
####################
All credits to Cante for bringing Pedro back to his old Guardiola's performance. The lad is on fire.
####################
Navas, biggest fraud on the pitch closely followed by Pedro.
####################

####################
@Belgian_Hotspur You mean Silva.
####################
Fabergas has been absent and is giving kante too much to do. Not fair
####################
David Luiz should be off. The Brazilian obstructed Kun Aguero and was last man. Anthony Taylor didn't even give a free kick.
####################
#lfc hell of a move by City.....Silva the organiser.
####################
@chelskigifs Its a tough call. Luis extends his arm, but aguero also dives big time. Good non call
####################
I don tire for the Navas guy
####################
David Silva provides perfect through ball results in Luiz block of an Aguero shot. #cityvcfc
####################
lol Aguero washed bitch
####################
Let's Agree to Disagree.  
But I need to know the meaning of dive if that was one "@deejayvise: What was it please? https://t.co/RnogCub9HS"
####################
He was right, Aguero went down too easily https://t.co/2w3eP3Albe
####################
Said it before, I'll say it again re Navas: Jesus hasn't had this much trouble with crosses since...
####################
Navas running alonso down the right

There aint a player more frustrating than Jesus Navas on the planet. 

Even Mignolet and Felleini aint this frustrating.

This time it's Aguero in behind but his lob, under pressure from David Luiz, goes well wide. #MCICHE
####################
At one end City want a foul after David Luiz bodychecked Aguero, at the other we head a corner wide. #MCICHE
####################
What a sublime pass from Silva #MCFCvCFC
####################
Aguero has a great chance to open the scoring but Azpilicueta is in the right place to block his goalbound shot. #MCICHE

####################
Still amazes me that Jesus Navas gets paid to literally just run and hit the first man with his cross
####################
@carolradull  #thescoreke hazard should have scored he isn't really world class
####################
@samuelluckhurst not for me, too far out and just wasn't enough in it, aguero could have easily stayed on his feet
####################
Its a shame Silva and Aguero are past their best years, they used to be INSANE. Shocking how they didnt win more titles
####################
Absolutely ridiculous to suggest Aguero was fouled. Nothing in it, and yet people are calling for a red card. Total nonsense.
####################
@RichJLaverty feels very cheap to give but I think he's covering his &amp; Azi's cock-up and Aguero had momentum so it's a foul
####################
Aguero should not score oo. After I've sold him from my fantasy team.
####################
Lol dawg I believe Navas is more confused of what to do when he beats his marker.
####################
you know when you're watching a football match and you're thinking he should play that pass, david silva plays that pass every single time

@thejoeld as if Costa wouldn't do exactly the same.

Could Sane not have headed that himself instead of pulling it back for Aguero? #MCICHE
####################
Hi @OptaJoe - any crossing stats on Jesus Navas finding the shins of the first defender during his Manchester City career?
####################
Too many stupid challenges. Silva and perennially Fernandinho. IDGAF about "breaking up the game".
####################
I guess it's okay Hazard is the most fouled player in the league. Fuck me.
####################
Watching David silva and Eden hazard play is just so pleasing on the eye

@DuncanCastles He didn't charge him. He just didn't move. I hate Luis but Aguero just Swan dived.

How wont the game still be 0-0 when the two teams are rocking blue lol https://t.co/GZtR2ckIXR
####################
If Zlatan did what Aguero had just done, he'd have been sent off for diving and given a 94 game ban.
####################
Aguero honesty only shows his blistering pace over the first 10 steps or so, after that, slow poke
####################
#amateur free pics costa rican sex girl https://t.co/JOEgRpitjx
####################
@SmaaashLive it was Fernandinho's header
####################
I guess it's the payback for when Aguero two footed Luiz but didn't get penalised. Karma.
####################
@GoaIkick Aguero just jumped on his elbow so there can be contact and therefore justify his dive
####################
David Silva glidessss. He'll probably still control a football fine while figure skater.
####################
Commentators are actually pained that the referee didn't give that free kick to aguero still whipping the dead horse smh
####################
Aguero can't move an inch. https://t.co/IHzDdFHpVL
####################
@StanCollymore definitely a red though no matter how easy Aguero went down
####################
@Martian_MUFC nah I'm a Hazard guy, Aguero second
####################
lol I remember Aguero jump in Luiz backside
####################
I legit had to check now if Gundogan is playing
####################
Fabregas has been useless so far in this game
####################
Call me naive but I think Chalobah should've started instead of Fabregas
####################
@Habzi12009 are you dumb Aguero ran into him, he was clearly looking for it
####################
That Aguero dive was so good it's got the commentators thinking he was actually fouled
####################
litt has just asked me "who's claudio bravo? the chelsea manager?"
####################
Walahi I've not seen Fabregas
####################
Aguero hast lost a yard of pace.. Em injuries have slowed him a bit.
####################
Why aren't we attacking Sane and Kolarov's side?
####################
Luiz is a dirty player but Aguero deserved a booking for that dive. #MCICHE
####################
Navas is still one of the worst players in the Premier league. Awful.
####################
Am I watching the same game or not Bravo is getting a lot of hate on the timeline
####################
Great tackle by David Luiz on Aguero but wtf is he doing on the right wing? Shouldn't need to be scrambling back #MCICHE

####################
@Mohaa_hdj hazard just had a spark but De bruyne has been consistent

Is Fabregas even playing?
####################
But it was a Barcelona-quality dive. Pep's influence shows through. https://t.co/Ve2qFjLUEN

Seems that terrible refereeing decisions are not limited to the the red half of Manchester. Blatant foul on Aguero by Sideshow Bob #MCFCvCFC

####################

I need a goal
####################
we're sat in a costa in a Waterstones

Aguero wins a corner off Cahill very close to the byline. #MCICHE
####################
So all you need to tackle a really good back three is  to have a passer as good as Silva. Not exactly replicable
####################
@rcarmichael11 Lmaooo I miss that one like hazard fa real

Come on now Gary let's have it right, aguero dived, a toddler could have stayed on his feet there
####################
Bar that blatant Aguero foul, David Luiz has been utterly superb..
####################
Aguero is the reason David Luiz's shirt is soiled. Footworks at display.
#MCICHE
####################
Seeing replay of Aguero, Luiz incident: Chelsea defender knew what he was doing stepping across. So did Aguero with his run. Luiz lucky.
####################
Pedro hasn't been playing on the right flank seems more through the middle there's a whole lotta space for victor Moses to cover
####################
David Silva glidessss. He'll probably still control a football fine while figure skating.
####################
Hazard is fucking magic pass it on https://t.co/XgtZjvt4R2

Still going on about luiz on aguero there's nowhere near enough contact to knock him down ,Ashley Young would of been booked for diving
####################
Eden Hazard in action! #CFC https://t.co/OzHk3MyJzH
####################
@CichonGblc @City_Watch are you fucking dumb lmao, he clearly purposely ran into the path of aguero
####################
Ball was free and Aguero was pacing to get to it
Luiz was not bothered to go fo the ball cos he knew he was gona obstruct Aguero
####################
How the hell does Jesus Navas get into this City team? Absolutely tragic player #cityvcfc

It is so clear that Nemanja Matic is missed, and what a poor stand-in Fabregas is in a game like this.
####################
Matic's absence is evident. Fabregas is useless defensively.
####################
Hahaha today Bravo isn't Neuring
####################
Hazard is different gravy
####################
Hazard, De Bruyne and Costa in my team. If this ends 0-0 I'm deleting my FPL account.
####################
@OIIieAFC so because Hazard fucked this one chance up, Sanchez is better? Great logic?
####################
Delughtful by Silva
####################
I liked this tweet then I saw you say David Luiz https://t.co/8EjVXP241t
####################
Cesc Fabregas is on the pitch
####################
Hazard didn't shoot because if he missed he would've been mocked. What a weak mentality.
####################
Fabregas has been a ghost worker so far...
####################
Worst crosser of the ball in the whole universe? Jesus Navas
####################
@Ballack give your opinion about Luiz-Aguero clash,Michael
####################
Bravo is on holiday
####################
I don't just like the Navas fella
####################
Where is fabregas??
####################
If there was an Ngolo Kante player cam, I would watch that for the full 90+ minutes. His positioning and spacial awareness are incredible
####################
If moses goes to the left wing or navas to right then we'll have a Jesus vs moses on the wing lmao

Moses and Pedro absolutely nonexistent. Let's not mention Fabregas

####################
Another of that pass to Sane Mr Silva and we'll be good.
####################
Fernandinho should have been booked twice, Luiz should have been booked/sent off &amp; Cahill should have been booked!! Pathetic ref #cityvcfc
####################
I almost forgot Fabregas is playing.
####################
Cahill what a fucking tackle
####################
@Dazlfchutchy but Aguero didn't have control of the ball and still had enough to do. Should have been a Free kick and a Yellow but not Red
####################
Aguero run into Luiz? If ebe Hazard anka udey cry
####################
Leave that he is the best anyway. https://t.co/UAuxTz7Qi3
####################
Conte seemed to be mouthing to Costa to "go to Stones". Hasn't had a whole heap of luck of him so far but must be a strategy.
####################
@JeMappelleEric possibly. Aguero does fabricate it a bit but it's still a blatant foul and last man. Good game this.

@chn_arsenal Think it has to do more with the fact that Navas and specially De Bruyne are moving on that area.

Like there's not even a tangential link between those two things.

Other than Bravo's henshin sounding a bit like Brave Heart I guess.

Hazard didn't miss. To miss, you have to shoot. Still the wrong option to pass, should have shot on goal.

Aguero should have gone for goal instead of looking for a cheap booking. #ManCityvsChelsea

@ChelseaFC fabregas is killing the midfield, drop that nigga please

everyone can see it, completely wrong game for fabregas. He can't get to the ball quick enough.

Aguero has a great chance to open the scoring  is in the right place to block his goalbound shot. #MCICHE

All this money and Navas still gets games smh
####################
Another shocking ref performance. Never a foul or yellow for Otamendi &amp; luiz def a foul on aguero. #fergiesrighttherefsareshite
####################
I know @unique_kwadwo is disappointed with how Navas has turned out, all them years on FM he couldn't buy him 'cause apparently he would...
####################
Gundagon has been non-existent. Completely forgotten he's been playing. Yaya supporting Aguero would be interesting.
####################
Alonso makes Navas look like a world class player fffssss
####################
Aguero the better striker by a mile
####################
Jesus Navas is just Shaun Wright Phillips that took Spanish classes

@Luizesque not the system. Too many players haven't turned up. Hazard &amp; Pedro anonymous so far

I hate watching Jesus Navas. Makes my blood pressure rise

I don't think I've ever been convinced with Jesus Navas, an incredibly limited winger.

@Jeresicz @Squawka its shoulder to shoulder and Aguero made the move towards Luiz first not a foul just like when Sanchez dove against PSG
####################
People tweeting a pic of one miss like Hazard would't be the best player in your team lmao

####################
People who think Aguero dived have never played Football. Luiz accelerates his upper body into him running full pelt, go figure. #mcfc #cfc
####################
Hey @MenInBlazers, I have a theory on Anthony Taylor's obvious CFC bias. Diego Costa has a Taylor family member tied up in his basement.

Damn, Aguero is so wasteful today.

Beckham the only player I've ever seen cross a ball like De Bruyne. Incredible pace, accuracy and trajectory so consistently

De Bruyne undoubtedly the best crosser in the league. It's Beckham-esque the whip and bend he gets on it. #MCICHE

Kante with the most important touch. Covering every inch of grass as usual
####################
Not a penalty. Kante brilliant but everything is starting from Alonso's side

The last person i saw crossing the ball like De Bruyne is Beckham

What a tackle Kante!!!!

City looking for every foul here. Strange. 

And it's not a biased thing, search my handle, Costa and foul and you'll see it isn't.

Kante will not even look at the Ref's face

Kevin de Bruyne is a freak. What a player. #MCICHE
####################
DE BRUYNE Crossing is the best in the premier league,what a phenomenol player

De Bruyne is better than Ozil mainly because he's two footed
####################
Gundogan is tragic man, never compare this guy with Labile
####################
Love how De Bruyne is playing deep.
####################
@Elliot_WG @JoshMyatt1 brilliant tackle by Kante
####################
@ManCity Missing the work rate of Raheem. But the technicality of KDB, Aguero and Silva MAGICAL!
####################
De Bruyne is without a doubt in the top 3 midfielders in the world!
####################
Cahill poor today, Azpi as usual top class. #CFC #ManCityvsChelsea
####################
@aaron_knighton he did make more of a movement agreed but aguero could have avoided him. Typical of players now though looking for a foul
####################
Alonso being doubled up on by KdB and Navas, Cahill needs to come out the pussy
####################
That's either a penalty or a fucking unbelievable tackle from Kante
####################
Hazard and costa combine like butter and bread honestly
####################
I am always right https://t.co/XMxdAabpei
####################
I'm sorry, but I'm starting to think De Bruyne has better deliveries than Ozil.
####################
What a block Kante my man
####################
De Bruyne's delivery of crosses and passing in general is phenomenal. Fashions out a chance 9 times / 10
####################
Cesc Fabregas so off the pace it's frightening. End to end games do not suit his style. #MCICHE
####################
Great defending that was from Kante
####################
@hilaryr @CNN Finally, a moment of news and not spin, supposition and attempts to entertain. Bravo! Hold 'em accountable.
####################
Gundogan hasn't appealed at all. That was a clean tackle. Fucking hell.
####################

####################
De Bruyne has been world class, bullying Chelsea with his movement. Alonso is going insane on that left side loll he's killing him
####################
Come on then people. RT.

The Aguero / Luiz clash was it ...
####################
@GNev2 That's not a foul on Aguero and you know it! Anywhere else on the pitch, it's not even a question! Get real!
####################
Close! Aguero's header from another great cross from De Bruyne goes just wide
####################
Kevin De Bruyne is arguably the best no. 10 at City (exception to Silva) but surprisingly there's no place for him at no. 10
####################
Aguero has missed 2 sitters ffs

For me cesc doesnt auit this system not doing enough in the moddle of the park and kante not looking himself coz thrying to over compensate

@aguerosergiokun Aguero heads wide from another splendid De Bruyne cross. Chance Manchester City. #PL
####################
@danbeames Kante is my very favourite footballer.
####################
Kante what a man!!!!
####################
'Last Man' *smh* https://t.co/8ySQPvuSZ4
####################
Can tell it's Chelsea's year. Aguero missing sitters.
####################

####################
@mightyfin15 watch costa get booked now!
####################
Carlos Bravo has a forehead longer than a week in jail. #TeffelNapper
####################
Kante is a baller
####################
Kolarov is shit wow
####################
The Missing. Bravo @BBC
####################
Aguero should have scored !
####################
@AniMiaOfficial If the troll is correct, then BRAVO!  I thought women are more healthy when their ribs aren't rubbing on their jackets.
####################
Wait, Fabregas is playing?
####################
Kante have my babies
####################
@the_art_of_fpl do you also have hazard and sanchez?
####################
Aguero goes close again, this time heading wide. How many chances do we need?
####################
He'll announce his presence with a goal, relax https://t.co/ruiAV9fl4x
####################
Disasterclass from Kante
####################
De Bruyne's passing is so clinical man. It's actually beautiful to watch!
####################
@RodneyMarsh10 defo bottled it so he didn't have to give a red. Can't get more of a goal scoring opportunity than Aguero clean through
####################
Chelsea defender reveals what makes Manchester City clash easier https://t.co/4dQPEIX8Hm https://t.co/H8UieIG9zf
####################
Fabregas absolutely missing.  Need to check if he's in that Chapecoense plane that crashed.  #Cityvscfc
####################
if i saw costa in real life id snuff him
####################
Gundogan didn't even complain there #MCICHE what's up with the crowd what match they watching???
####################
De Bruyne could deliver your pizza before you order it.
####################
What a tackle by Kante!
####################
De Bruyne is another version of Thomas Muller. They don't have any visible impact but they're the most dangerous
####################
Hazard is top 5 in the world lol, a missed chance means nothing
####################
Gundogan one of the flops of the season?
####################
@utdjolie maybe if costa or pedro got up the field quick enough, it would have been a tap in.
####################
All Kevin de bruyne's crosses today have Vatican approval.
####################
De bruyne is showing why he's my favourite player
####################
Fabregas not taken his chance in my opinion
####################
Don't think there's a player I hate more than costa
####################
The best transfer move during the last transfer window has to be KANTE. Left a big vacuum in Leicester and filled a big vacuum in Chelsea
####################
The Belgium contingent of Hazard and De Druyne are a beauty to watch. Class!!!

#MCICHE
####################
brilliant tackle from Kante
####################
Kante's heat map must be the maddest after every game
####################
De Bruyne is so good. Wasting his time feeding the evergreen bottler Aguero. Needs to be at Barca feeding Messi &amp; Suarez with tap ins.
####################
Chelsea started strongly but City been well on top for last 15. Silva/Sane linking well. Aguero good chances. Home crowd not having ref
####################
I think de bruyne stays back in training for 2 extra hours practicing these pin point deliveries into the box. Mad
####################
Not many better crosses of the ball in world football than De Bruyne. Always on a dime. #PoetryInMotion #CmonCity
####################
Gundogan didn't even bother complaining, which says a lot
####################
That was class by the African lookalike Kante
####################
De Bruyne's delivery has been exceptional
####################
24. @fernandinho has the ball in thom @DeBruyneKev's set piece - great header! BUT! Offside given! (0-0) #cityvcfc
https://t.co/DurbV5SNBW
####################
Costa is scared of Stones, he won't jump with him.
####################
Costa said Fuck that give him yellow dammit
####################
Ain't gonna lie....every time De Bruyne crosses one in I quake a bit
####################
How has Diego Costa not got 5 yellow cards already this season?
####################
De Bruyne's delivery from the right is Beckhamesque, but so much more to his game.
####################
#Kilo Two Bravo&lt;&lt;   &gt;&gt;https://t.co/R9WSDjMJ0e #myfirstTweet #porn
####################
Every time I see De Bruyne he's the best player on the pitch.
####################
Costa has been an absolute gentleman this year
####################
WHAT HAS COSTA DONE? ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
####################
I think Cesc Fabregas should be substituted.he's so missing in action. We need the 3points.
#Chelsea 
#ManCityvsChelsea
####################
The Luiz on Aguero one isn't a foul, not for me.
####################
Pedro Not supporting Alonso on the left side....
#MCICHE
####################
I can pay my last penny to watch De Bruyne play football
####################
What a challenge from Kante
####################
De Bruyne is unbelievable  #cityvcfc
####################
Reckon the Ref's done alright here, Aguero was looking for it far too much and that was a solid tackle #MCICHE
####################
Aguero should of left that
####################
Second fucking penalty denied. Now costa with an elbow. 11vs12
####################
Ronaldo and Messi aside, de bruyne is the best player in the world #MCICHE
####################
@ChelseaFC Kante is brilliant.
####################
Kante is the man
####################
Like Gundogan,like Messi. No complaints.#MCICHE
####################
@ygburt 0-0 but de bruyne is just exposing us at the back never seen us open like this
####################
@MUwaysNisar Aguero through on goal, Luiz was last man &amp; clipped him - no red/foul given
####################
Kevin De Bruyne's delivery is so good
####################
Kante oh my god
####################
@deejayfaremi it's not jare,  that was a clean tackle from Kante
####################
What a tackle that was by Kante!! #MCICHE
####################
@HenryJ16 pundits and media have it out for both Luiz and Costa. Whilst I can't deny that it could have been a red, it's true
####################
Hazard and DeBruyne are two best players for both teams #MCICHE
####################
#MCICHE Aguero missing too many chances in this game missing a couple of them
####################
De Bruyne can put one hell of a cross in #MCICHE
####################
Kante's defence is something else
####################
De Bruyne has so many things in his locker.
####################
MISS! Kevin de Bruyne whips in an unbelievable cross which finds Aguero but he heads wide. Big chance for City. #MCFC 0-0 #CFC #PLonNBC
####################
Kdb is damn good! Best midfielder in the league rn https://t.co/hZiLrxn2L2
####################
Aguero just misses with a header on the end of another superb De Bruyne cross. #cityvcfc
####################
Costa need to be booked the ugly monkey looking cunt
####################
If Costa had the service Aguero is getting we'd be two three goals up.
####################
GIVE KANTE A STATUE

Fabregas is so shit. Changes dynamic of entire Chelsea squad
####################
Urgh take off FABREGAS!
####################
Dunno what Kolarov was thinking there. Lucky to get the foul
####################
Leroy Sane not better than Jesus Navas? Sell that kid
####################
Fuckin hell De Bruyne's crosses are so perfect every time. Definitely conceding from one if we don't stop them from coming in
####################
Aguero constantly asking questions
####################
Chelsea will have to cut these KDB crosses from source or it's just time before he perfectly finds Aguero's head.
####################
Costa is lost so far.
####################
Fabregas must come off
####################
Did Costa just say "fuck that". Good English my man. #CFC

####################
Never gets old https://t.co/wo94JLaS3Z

Did Kante the ball there? If so, more credit to him what a player what a tackle
####################
-Hey, Pedro, do your cow smoke?. -No, why?. -Then is burning you stable.
####################
Kante is truly special. As if he's been playing at Chelsea his whole life
####################
Notice costa disappearing in a big game but it won't get mentioned
####################
Watch out Man City. "Angry" Diego Costa is back
####################
Please what happened to Matic, Fabregas is out of form #MCICHE
####################
Navas is a bum Walcott isn't but is made out to be that's my point https://t.co/EsJi4nFYTs
####################
Fabregas isn't exactly the man for this game
####################
Costa doesn't know how to dribble
####################
This you? https://t.co/Rr2estpenV
####################
De Bruyne finding short players with his crosses. Sensational.
####################
@Danogden15 thats either a pen and a red card or tackle of the season from kante
####################
Why on earth did Chelsea sell de bruyne
####################
The Angry Diego Costa 

#MCICHE
####################
What a tackle Kante!!
####################
Love Diego Costa. Plays the game the way it should.
####################
How many Chances does Aguero Need? #MCICHE
####################
Cesc just floating through the game. https://t.co/8lQ5Pri525
####################
Even though David Luiz' foul was a blatant card I'd say either him or David Silva are on track for the match ball

####################
Fabregas is the best jogger today lmao.
####################
Look at De Bruyne 's crossing lmao world-class
####################
how shit is Aguero.  Giroud would've buried that.
####################
I thought that was a penalty till I realised it was kante who made the tackle.
####################
Watching De bruyne's passing is giving me eyegasm right now
####################
Aguero missing too many chances..
####################
@dwil94 Aguero is a diving pussy ass bitch.
####################
Lol Costa is how old again ?
####################
His deliveries are a beauty https://t.co/WDCW8dbACu

Costa small small.

This idiot wan vex Costa oh

#MCICHE
####################
Not even Debatable https://t.co/PgktRNccjy
####################
Costa and cesc are missing..
####################
@FreeTipsSBT could have been a yellow , but I think aguero's reaction made the ref think it was a dive #MCICHE
####################
The beast within Costa will wake up now just wait
####################
De Bruyne's passing ability is one of the best things in football. Nails everything. #MCICHE
####################
Sometimes I sit and wonder why I named my dog N'Golo, but then when I watch Kante play on a Saturday it all makes sense again.
####################
City want a penalty for a foul by Kante but ref Taylor ignores their appeals. #MCICHE

https://t.co/DurbV5SNBW
####################
Kante's tackle &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
####################
Great to see Brannagan, Pedro and Ojo start together again. Been a while. #ballers #LFC
####################
I think it worries my girlfriend when I sit here calling Kante daddy
####################
Going to be unreal when Costa scores and Anthony Taylor celebrates by removing his referee shirt revealing the Chelsea jersey under.
####################
Surely de Bruyne is the best player in the PL
####################
David Silva is so underrated! If he was at Barcelona or Real Madrid he would be regarded as one of the best but that's deluded fans for you!
####################
Navas's crossing ability is wet socks
####################
The formation isn't favorable for him https://t.co/9Cvy348SGZ
####################
SILVA - water, flower (1998) https://t.co/6oSNT7Z1bo
####################
43- City appeal for another penalty for a foul by Kante on Gundogan but its waved away. 0-0 #MCICHE
####################
De Bruyne's delivery from wide areas is of a David Beckham standard today. Absolute quality!

 #MCFCvCFC
####################
To be fair it is a shit opinion but Thorgan Hazard is still young and got a lot of time to improve https://t.co/TfPNh7d97U
####################
That Kante Tackle Was Just Magical. #CFC
####################
What is the point of a Jesus Navas? 

#MCFCvCFC https://t.co/oARCuTkaxC
####################
Give the ball to Kevin De Bruyne! What a player!
####################
@HazardFlicks hazard really should've done more with that
####################
Pinpoint crosses from De bruyne more like that and it'll be in the back of the net soon! #MCICHE
####################
It's unfair having De Bruyne and Silva in the same team
####################
De Bruyne is one of the best midfielders in the league.
####################
The way De Bruyne delivers those crosses....
####################
Another big chance squandered by that fraud Aguero. Costing City the game.
####################
Diego Costa the elephant man! #COYG
####################
Kante might be the best destroyer of all time
####################
De bruyne creating chances like
####################
How good are De Bruyne's crosses though
####################
Aguero would have grabbed the match ball by now if United were the opponents
####################
Incredible recovery from Kante, saved us a goal.
####################
Sensational tackle from Kante. City the better side here
####################
City want a penalty for a foul by Kante but ref Taylor ignores their appeals. #MCICHE

Wonder if Lando ago cuss Navas same way
####################
City by far the better team in the 1st half. Quality of De Bruyne and Aguero on show. Chelsea should be down to 10.
####################
Alonso has let Navas cross all fucking game he's a left footed Peter Crouch, lanky twat
####################
Cahill with an elite finish there. Can't blame him really. What, he should leave it for Aguero?
####################
Lmaoooo! Cahill is just the joke that keeps on giving. #MCFCvCFC

Jesus Navas has picked out a Chelsea player with every single pass in final third and it finally pays off. #MCFCvCFC

Unfortunate own goal for Cahill off a Navas cross. City get lucky on the cusp of half time. #cityvcfc
####################
Lovely Finish by Cahill! Love seeing chelsea concede, now the pundits can stop worshiping the way they play 5 at the back!
####################
Navas has found his niche I guess, hitting the first man from a cross is good if that man is Gary Cahill

Cahill is a profession footballer and can't even using his weak foot. Emabrassing.

I never got the reluctance from professional soccer players to use both pegs. Cahill you have 2 use the left one.
####################
Combination of Alonso's inability to defend, Navas' inability to cross and Cahill being an absolute idiot = goal
####################
Come on Hazard, step up
####################
Cahill where the fuck is your left foot

An OWN GOAL! FFS Cahill. Wrong defender there.

Oh Gary... Cahill own goal. Been coming. City doing to Chelsea what their front three has done so well of late taking up awkward positions.
####################
That sums us up so far: Alonso can't even put a ball down the line properly, then Hazard just gave up on it completely
####################
Sumptuous Cahill Own Goal!!!! #Fab curse??
####################
Alonso never won a ball against Navas today
####################
Omg Cahill, please get Zouma in #MCICHE
####################
Cahill or not.  A goal was bound to happen in that format. Man City were connecting too many dangerous balls in Chelsea's box. Too many.
####################
Greatest goal Cahill has ever scored .
####################
@ChelseaFC Cahill doing the Smalling style
####################
Goallllll , thanks Cahill
####################
Really dont get opponents against Navas, hes more predictable than Valencia, pick up ball kick to his right cross rinse repeat..
####################
Kante is really suffering o, cheya
####################
Terry always used his head. I have No idea why cahill used his feet.

####################
England's finest - Gary Cahill.
####################

####################
Get cahill to fuck such a fucking retard
####################
@MelancholyW0lf absolute joke mate if that was Luiz hesistating like he did vs Costa he would get a grilling off everybody
####################
Descanso: Gary Cahill 1-Chelsea 0.
####################
At least Jesus Navas finally put a good ball into the box
####################
Cahill must've been watching Skrtel comps, world class finish
####################
Scintillating football?...run down the wing and whip it in for Aguero or a deflection. How are you better than Westbrom?
####################
Great Finish from Cahill..
#MCFCvCFC
####################
Tim cahill is surely being wasted...  he should be a striker #MCIvsCHELSEA

####################
What a Beauty from Gary Cahill..outstanding finishing!
Oops..wrong end! #MCICHE
####################
"Why Always Me" is now Cahill's most distinct phrase. The nightmares just wouldn't stop.

Gary Cahill with a finish @IanWright0 would have been proud of #MCICHE

Where is Fabregas
####################
Make it happen https://t.co/xCV5NjPWZn
####################
Cahill normally scores right after an own goal
####################
Cannot wait for Kurt Zouma to be fit again. Cahill's the weakest link of this XI by miles. Shits himself every time he gets pressed.
####################
Good one https://t.co/dsAcfwiVR4
####################
Cahill how not to clear a cross . Goal of the month contender.
####################
GOOOOAALLL City!!!  Cahill OG!  What a game this has been so far. @ManCity #CmonCity

####################
Nothing you can do there. Cahill costing us points
####################

Pathetic from Cahill
####################
Gary Cahill really is awful
####################
So I've got Aguero, Pedro and Hazard in my team and there's been a goal. Oh..... Ffs.
####################
Always said Alonso-Cahill side is our weakest part
####################
This is what people don't notice about luiz and Terry they both clear that with their left foot but not Cahill.. ffs
####################
When I said score a goal I didn't mean on yourselves https://t.co/C10Kd0JZLq
####################
How many games has Cahill cost us?
####################
And Gary Cahill is emphatically back.
####################
When bicycle kicks aren't your thing #cahill #MCICHE
####################
Cahill wow
####################
Cahill mostly at blame but what about Alonso not stopping the cross? Gave him far too much space.
####################
Conte should get a statue for being able to win 7 cons. games with Moses, Cahill, David Luiz, Pedro and Marcos Alonso in the same team.
####################
The tough question is who is worse Cahill or Luiz? Both Championship quality players
####################
WTF WERE YOU THINKING CAHILL
####################
Cahill is an Ass
####################
We are still looking for Fabregas

On the bright side, Gary Cahill, cracking goal, even if it was at the wrong end

@hughwizzy i cant believe Hazard didnt shoot that ..
####################
Alonso is not a defender. Awful player. Him and Cahill on that left side are our weakness.
####################
@StanCollymore still can't believe how one footed some of these top players are. Perfect example by Cahill there.

I think the word "halfcaste" has fallen out of favour in the past few years, but I'd have Kante's halfcaste babies! #MCICHE

Cahill was always the weak link in that defence since the match began....
####################
Chelsea are still in this tho.. need to get hazard and costa more involved.. willian on for pedro won't be the worst idea either
####################
Erm puskas award for cahill??
####################
How comforting is it to know Gary Cahill is first choice centre half for England #football #PremierLeague
####################
Fabregas has used his own money to buy his ticket out of Chelsea. First class too.
####################
Goal was coming. KDB, Silva are dictating the space in between the lines. Way too many dangerous balls played in behind.
####################
Alonso needs to come off. Fabregas needs to come off.
####################
Gary Cahill is that he wouldn't even get a game for us.

That left hand side of the defence has been pretty poor. Alonso and Cahill constantly being dragged out of position. No pace there.

@elusiveblue69 see why fabregas been no where near a game either....not had a kick
####################
Brilliant goal that was tho from Mr Cahill
####################
Alonso was exposed too much and Cahill was erratic throughout the half. Excellent showcase of he is only a short time solution
####################
Gary Cahill choosing the worst possible time to show us his Bruce Lee impression... #MCICHE #CFC

Missing Matic. Fabregas is awful

####################
How many goals have they conceded in the last 7 games? Plus it's a back 3 you unfunny morons https://t.co/sSbXPnqrmv
####################
If Hazard and Cahill had both trusted their left foot, this'd be 1-0 Chelsea.
####################
HT: #MCFC 1-0 #CFC

What a cracking finish by Gary Cahill just before the end of the half!
####################
Hazard should've buried that chance. No excuses
####################
Deserved reward for City enterprise and probing, Chelsea frontmen of Costa and Hazard have been anonymous https://t.co/ddcDVKxKPz

Why TF is zouma and terry both playing for under 23 when we have Cahill that shit head
####################
Why didn't hazard shoot, getting me mad
####################
Brilliant finish from Cahill shame for him was wrong end #Cahill as for Anthony Taylor what a bottler #Anthonytaylor #bottler
####################
I tell you https://t.co/vPU65ata8x
####################
That's how first half finished and I didn't even see fabregas
####################
Pep's worked-out how to get in behind Chelsea's back 5: spin Aguero down the channels, KDB pull/ out wide + play early balls into the box.
####################
Best indeed https://t.co/eQqhdLqsu6
####################
Cahill you stupid fuck !
####################
You're joking right? That's how we're gonna concede a goal? Cahill you're the biggest idiot in the whole world. Jesus awful smh #MCICHE

####################
CAHILL SCORES AN OWN GOAL AND SUDDENLY HE IS SHIT AGAIN LMAO STFU YOU DICKS
####################
Guess Fabregas won't return for 2nd half, awful performance. This must be his last season with Chelsea.
####################
Gary Cahill is an absolutely atrocious centre half
####################
Just Gary Cahill being Gary Cahill.
####################
Cahill we score a header don't worry #epl
####################
Cahill instead of Costa upfront? #MCICHE
####################
@Zonal_Marking More of the same in the second half after that Cahill finish! Who is supposed to be picking De Bruyne up in that zone? Cesc?

Fabregas hasn't asserted himself in this game. Its annoying. Alonso long balls need to stop.

How are people calling that Luiz challenge a foul and red card? Didn't even budge into Aguero at all. 50-50.

Alonso must take the blame too, where was he? he should've been marking Navas, it was his side. Very poor from Alonso when defending

Alonso has been given the runaround, Fabregas invisible

Why was Cahill's first thought not to smash the ball back the way it came?

Cahill has caused 90% of City's corners, at least he did something different this now, not for the good though

####################
@Frediot I shit you not a friend and I tracked this in the mboro game. Navas touched the ball with his left foot 3 times
####################

wait hazard missed an open goal? L but I'm not gonna go on lol he's had a top season calm down

But Alonso. This is the second match dude has been shaky. I also can't forget Fab. Fab hasn't helped Kante at all

@Avant77 How Many Own Goals Does Cahill Score Per Season?
####################
Halftime: Aguero couldn't get a shot on target, so Cahill did it for him. To be fair, Man City w/ the better chances that half. Chelsea 1-0.

@soljabiru puskas award for cahill
####################
@ChelseaFC : Stupid F***! Third time this season Cahill would make a mistake to cause a goal..or was he paid to concede that own goal??
####################
@Batshuayiiii but you can't allow an amazing Cahill goal? Double Standards, typical CIS scum.
####################
@piplabs there's a guy somewhere out there with Navas ordering the pub he's in a round!
####################
Gary Cahill proving once again how vital it is  to have a relibale English defender playing alongside David Luiz.

Its okay cahill. JT used to score at his own net. But he fixed his mistakes. Hope you do the same

Cahill always has to be the unfortunate one

Why didn't Hazard shoot when he took it past the keeper? How tight was the angle?

Took me time to actually believe that was an Aguero dive. 
Really strange to witness good decisions being made by referees nowadays though.

If that Cahill acrobatic volley goal was scored by Ozil, Arsenal fans would have have brought twitter down by now.

Can't Blame cahill. Come you boys. We need a strong second half

KDB and aguero causing all the problems. Costa virtually nonexistent in that half

Can't tell there's Fabregas in the middle. Luiz has been best &amp; even then he's lucky about the non call #MCICHE

That Fabregas pass to hazard was sublime and beautiful

Right this is it. We need a world class LWB and 2 CBs. Alonso and Cahill are the Achilles Heel in our backline.

How is Navas still playing this level of football? He's atrocious.
####################
Summer transfer, Cahill has to get booted. He has cost us way too many times

@FabsCFC nah, cross wasn't going anywhere, Cahill HAS to leave it, or at least go with his left. Shocking decision. Alonso should stop t tho

Got to admire Cahill's athleticism there

You see, Moses, Cahill, Alonso... ALL 3 not talented enough at this moment for the big occasions. Don't let  wins fool you.

Cahill's block flies into Chelsea's top corner on stroke of HT to break deadlock in end-to-end match, Man City lead 1-0
####################
Superb finish from cahill
####################
@ElusivePhantom yeah probably.Aguero provides a different dimension though
####################
Not feeling Aguero's play today. His finishing has been off
####################
Cahill MCE 4 life #ManCity #Chelsea
####################
Spot on. https://t.co/zVF52HRNuO
####################
Cahill is the weak link in the back three, but he should be doing much better than that. That was poor
####################
And also #aguero scored :)
####################
The cross was still trash tho. Wouldn't find a city player if left untouched by Cahill https://t.co/UdoFE99m9O
####################
Top finish  from Cahill into his own goal.
####################
Aguero! Tonnes of ability, not an ounce of class
####################
Who is this Chelsea fan? https://t.co/FiXn0D7UCn
####################
No chill RT @peekaymila: Cahill scored since Man City players are dulling."
####################
When is zouma coming back cahill has been hell
####################
Aguero almost celebrated with him https://t.co/lIg7giBazf
####################
The real blues!! https://t.co/ntE6wj99iW
####################
Sorry for Cahill; played well until then but that was properly daft. #cfc #MCICHE
####################
Brilliant goal by Cahill
####################
Even half and happy to go into halftime up 1-0, De Bruyne has been excellent, hopefully this maintains in the next half.
####################
Too much Eden Hazard disrespect on the timeline. 

He's better than your clubs best player.
####################
Why is fabregas getting stick? Man city running rings round the whole squad
####################
Cahill just scored the best goal I've ever seen
####################
De Bruyne running the show aswell, top player
####################
Fabregas nowhere to be seen. Should be playing for Burnley tbh
####################
Cheers Cahill you knob I have you in me #FPL
####################
Everyone gonna forget Luiz pocketed aguero that half because aguero is weak lmao

Brilliant goal by Cahill.. But man city are 1-0 up
####################
"Aguero, this is how you score."
####################
Fabregas is playing nothing in this game... He's just too quiet!
####################
poor decision there from Cahill... left leg should av been a better option... lol
####################
Dear Cahill
Why?

Own goal (Cahill) but we will take it. 1-0 up! C'MON CITY! #MCFC

Fabregas hasn't had any opportunity to get into this game, I'd just take him off asap if we don't change how we're playing.

Fuck those Arsenal fans crying for Arsenal to sign Fabregas in January. State of this fanbase.

@Nallenesque definitely we were only going to get one big chance and hazard blew it

It was unlucky from Cahill but Alonso wasn't even trying to defend..mans been chillin all day.

Not a bad finish from Cahill to be fair to him

So, Fabregas needs to go back to where he's needed the most in this new system...the bench

The game has completely flew by Fabregas.. You could say the same about Gundogan too.

####################
Yoh @MWiriGimiLLeR what is a Cahill?
####################
I just really don't get Gary Cahill at all
####################
Zouma and Terry get fit asap!!!! I can't take watching Cahill defend. It's not the own goal, it's he has been him been beating by De Bruyne.

Don't care if we lose just someone break Aguero's face

Can't really blame Cahill for that , pressure was too much .

Alonso, Cesc and Cahill poor first half

Aguero, Costa, Hazard and De Bruyne on the pitch - none of them could have finished that better than Gary Cahill did. #MCICHE

#PL Halftime- Manchester City 1-0 Chelsea (G. Cahill o.g)...
####################
Guardiola' slow percentage tactics worked. Very disappointing goal to concede, poor from Cahill.
####################
A really shouldn't have put Cahill in
####################
@TweetChelseaUK fabregas replacing Matic has been the biggest issue. The back three are being pulled into areas they do not want to be
####################
That's not even the problem here. Spurs dominated us too even with Matic. There's more to this going down by HT https://t.co/OLA4oOymM4
####################
Fabregas is so weak at that midfield, so Alonso had to feel the pressure..

Don't even blame Cahill for that goal

Man like Cahill!

Go injure yourself again twat https://t.co/tYI8IvsIcm

That goal though by Cahill! SPECTACULAR!!

If only hazard would have chipped the keeper.

yall ever notice that this nigga cahill always be making mistakes

a nice Pedro double (assisted by Costa of course) &amp; another OG will suit me down to the ground. Or just 1 Pedro goal &amp; OG for a nice bet win

Not seeing Fabregas at all  #CFC

He is not even 30 yet, and Fabregas already looks like a waste of time at this level of football. Na wa.

Trust Cahill. He will come back strong. @ChelseaFC @Bridget_Otoo #MCICHE

Finally we found someone who could score from a Navas cross #MCFC
####################
@StraightupSimPL @HazardEdition don't think so.. They deserved the lead, would've been different if hazard would've tucked that one
####################
definitely need players to cover for players like Kante , Matic , Alonso etc , heck a good lwb can replace Alonso the way he's been playing
####################
It seems reactionary to say this now, but Cahill in the wide centre back role always seemed like a weakness in this Chelsea back three.
####################
I hate how people turn against the players the minute a mistake happens. #MCICHE Like honestly Cahill was acting in the moment.
####################
take away fabregas put on willian
####################
Cahill top ins
####################
Poor decision by Cahill to use his right leg to clear that cross. Should have used his left. #MCICHE

Oh gary Cahill defenders mistake you don't stick your right leg out in that position you stick YOUR FUCKING LEFT LEG YOU TWAT #MCICHE
####################
@Chelsea_HQ what do you think about FABREGAS???

Cahill deadly inside the box

####################
What does Navas offer City? He has pace, but he hasn't got the skill to actually make use of it. No technical ability at all.
####################
Haha RT @RichJolly: Jesus Navas' plan of hitting the first defender with a cross finally pays off. Genius.
####################
Chelsea fans can claim Hazard's touch was taking him wide all they want but if Sanchez is in the same position he scores

####################
#MCICHE Thats not a foul
Aguero dived to be nice to you this time David ya useless cute whore
Clever bastard
####################
Cahill.. overrated adam. Kendi kalesine gol at worst time. Like agst Arsenal, Cahill destroys his team. In transfer window, Italian def pls
####################
Love that Navas is still at City aimlessly whipping balls into the mixer.. and that's a shoot!
####################
man 1: 0 Che: As usual it has to be Gary Cahill scoring on behalf of ManCity. #CahillAgain

You're loosin @ the oda end"@ChelseaFC: At the other end, Hazard takes the ball past Bravo but his cutback doesn't find a teammate. #MCICHE"
####################
Fabregas has been given another chance to stake a claim on d first team and he is failing miserably
####################
I am also surprised. That's all the likes of KDB, Silva have done the whole half. https://t.co/c2scwFaCz1

@acsparta_en Costa is versatile he can play either center back or left back
####################
Captain Fantastic ----------&gt; Cahill
####################
Terrible defending by Cahill, but that goal was coming to be fair. #CFC
####################
Referee was poor. Kolarov's long ball party trick seems to have gone again and we needed a Cahill OG to score but 1-0 is better than 0-0

Now why did I put this Cahill thing on my fantasy team.....Lousy guy
####################
Chelsea wing back have been pinned to the back..
It now seems they have just Cesc anc Kante in middle. Hazard dropping a bit to help thou
####################
Marcos Alonso giving Navas too much space on the right side #MCICHE Navas is very predictable Get to the line n cross or come back and pass
####################
How Cahill is still a Chelsea player is beyond me

Oh my God, Cahill!!! #CFC
####################
Fabregas was absent. Painful.
####################
gary cahill no blame attached. could have done nothing. intention was right, but wrong leg.
####################
@Shegstein yea, not the strongest defensive player like Moses - but Kante supports Moses, Matic is not here to help Alonso out
####################
Cahill is always the giver. What a Man !
####################
@Itani @hughwizzy he tried squaring it to Costa
####################
Matic is definitely missed. Defensively Chelsea haven't been as good and Fabregas hasn't even been noticed. #CHEMCI #MCICHE
####################
3 costly mistakes from Cahill, interim Chelsea captain this season. Its affecting the game.
####################
Cahill u beautiful piece of shit.....#cahill
####################
Loool Aguero was celebrating with Cahil https://t.co/WZlweuvsy8

Stop bashing Cahill because "he's been amazing in the last 7 games" is such a retard excuse.
Inexcusable mistake. Fuck off.

Cahill with a beauty
####################
CAHILL DESERVES 2 POINTS ON FPL FOR SUCH A SUBLIME FINISH. DON'T SUBTRACT ANYTHING !! https://t.co/ErG9vPPCt1
####################
In fairness to Gary Cahill it's a majestic finish. Didn't realise he had those acrobatics in the locker...
####################
Whyyyyy omg there's no reason to use ur right foot https://t.co/qSqFGZHG4G
####################
Can u imagine how furious conte is. Cahill probably getting shouted at rn
####################
Cesc covers 0 ground which is why De Bruyne so open, Chalobah needed. Anyone could've scored an own goal. Cmon Chelseaaaa
####################
What a goal from Cahill.... Shame it's the wrong goal
####################
@chn_arsenal They are missing gundogan.I don't they miss mikhi/hummels as much as I thought they would.He is doing very well actually.
####################

Most strikers dream of scoring that Cahill goal.
####################
Cahill is gift goal scorer! #ManCityvsChelsea https://t.co/mHUCVTbAK6

Also, Fabregas isn't working. Such a mess.

####################
@ChelseaFC fabregas has been poor,can't tackle can't pass,time to retire
####################
Unbelievably poor from Hazard. More responsible for this L than Cahill.
####################
Nope https://t.co/SqZzsRcEPG
####################
Lool.... I tell u https://t.co/VksK8U3dB7
####################
Marcos Alonso defensive abilities is shit and Hazard should have scored
####################
Btw that Luiz "foul" on Aguero wasn't. Way too soft
####################
FUCK SAKE CAHILL! Clear with your left foot not with your right foot and right before half time as well bollocks.
####################
Poor, unfortunate Cahill though.
####################
With Navas doing his usual thing, &amp;  considering what KdB is doing here https://t.co/5dbUlWuOTx he's still  creating mismatches on the wings
####################
Gary Cahill confusing light blue with dark blue and netting an own goal the fucking cunt  #MCICHE #chelseafc
####################
Gonna be a rugby score if Navas keeps attacking Alonso
####################
David Luiz has cleared balls from that wing thousands of times with his left leg.. this guy Cahill is a massive bellend
####################
Fabregas went from one of the best players in the world to a Spanish El Neny
####################
Third quality cross that has come in from the left side . Cahill unlucky. Game was evenly poised. Still time to turn it around.
####################
Like since the game started KDB and navas have attacked Alonso with no help
####################
Aguero definitely winning the battle of the #9s so far, been unreal. Movement has been outrageous, absolute killa
####################
HT with City in front, Cahill own goal on the stroke. Can Chelsea fight back this time?

https://t.co/KXoSe4YA9i

####################
Fabregas be -1 
We playing 10 against 11.
####################
I hope @ChelseaFC lose - that way we can see Cahill get famous !
####################
Chelsea did well up until then, despite De Bruyne and Silva playing brilliantly, but it was only a matter of time before City scored.
####################
Gary Cahill at it again......

####################
Navas inability to beat the first man finally pays off
####################
@ChelseaFC Cahill start playing like fucking Luiz he has been amazing you are like a disabled kid trying to kick a ball
####################
Some delightful balls from Silva &amp; Cesc. Costa quiet today, won't be the first big game he'll simmer down
####################
I love Cahill for what he's achieved but let's be honest, he's another that isn't our level anymore. Replace him and Alonso next season imo
####################
Nice doe goal cahill
####################
@RoseGoldNgwenya I've said Cahill and Luiz are lies. We waiting on Zouma to be fully fit.

Cahill has been horrible today. He finally capped it up with an own goal. Smh
####################
@CesxFabregas Chelsea ultras should abuse both Cahill and Alonso to death, get them dropped and get the main man Terry back in defence

Nkt. You're only as good as your last game https://t.co/SuIZx1OsBG
####################
I suppose the only way a Navas cross was going to result in a goal was to hit an opposition player
####################
@Jtartarkin why is Cahill leading with the wrong leg? #he'scack
####################
Definitely see Cahill being the one to lose his place in the team when Zouma is fit. That's at least 3 fuck ups by Cahill this year #MCICHE
####################
@SimplySouthend is Fabregas playing? Honest question
####################
@Rquinn1998 Chelsea are clearly missing Matic. The right half space/wing is being controlled by #MCFC, Fabregas not involved in pressing...
####################
Fabregas doesn't understand the 3-4-3 machine

Good that Chelsea concede for #FPL. Even better it's a Cahill OG.

I think I took Cahill out my fantasy team, probably first break I've had since September 2015
####################
Kante should come to Manchester United.
####################
And Aguero every time in the air, being bailed out by Luiz and Dave and his poor passing and general bad positioning. He has lost it. #cfc
####################
@azkhawaja1 pep's city targeted right side,debruin and navas playing gud
First pep thrash barca and  now playing awesome against Chelsea

@98TW_ uhh Aguero ran into Luiz, it's a rule that handball in the penalty box is now more lenient

I want coffee but costa is too far with these bagS

Very tight game with exciting flow. First half deserve a goal but not through an own goal. De Bryne and Fabregas has caught my attention.
####################
Willian and Matic should come on, Pedro and Alonso should go off... Game still much open #MCICHE

@humzahjogee1 you're kidding yourself. The Cahill challenge is much more dangerous as the player can't protect himself.

Fabregas isn't ding any tangible thing on the pitch. Not saying he has been bad, but we could play with 10 men and not miss him.

####################
Goal of the season -cahill
####################
Decent 1st half. Hazard should've aimed for goal. Great chance. Some decent breaks not well executed. Azpi almost did Luiz. Alonso awful!
####################
Costa needs to get himself on the scoresheet. I need dem points.
####################
Another Gary Cahill error leading to a goal... #MCICHE
####################
Nothing more satisfying than a Cahill fuck up
####################
Alonso and Anthony Taylor having a mare. Hazard's decision making has been awful.
####################
That Cahill own-goal just won someone 14000/-...

Gundogan is one decent midfielder. Tap-tap, no time for nonsense
####################
Gary is the weak link of the back 3.  Not a left cb. https://t.co/3lFxrrZpka
####################
Yet another shit ref, shithoused out of 2 decisions. Blatant foul on Aguero by Luiz and as he was last man, should have walked. Plus penalty
####################
Gary Cahill has two goals under his name this season.  #MCICHE
####################
That it's awful defending by Gary Cahill and that is why he should be no where near the England side.
####################
You can see most of De Bruyne's crosses have been like his cross to Aguero against Middlesborough(H). Think Pep wanted him to keep using 1\2
####################
De Bruyne's crosses into the box are a thing of beauty. Such crosses deserve goals. Always in the danger areas.
####################
Great finish from Cahill though.
####################
Hazard out. Bring on Ivanovic.
####################
@lukemcewen been saying it since last season about Cahill, also when we brought alonso. Regardless of form they ain't good enough.
####################
Hazard way to unselfish. Messi Ronaldo Bale Neymar Sanchez etc would have easily guided that ball in the net. He warn cut back smh
####################
Fabregas giving Kante lots of work... like he's not even in this game
####################
my best player that half for Chelsea has been Luiz, yes despite the obvious red card he got away with, Kante &amp; Moses also doing well
####################
Cahill at it sabotaging again
####################
Pls bring Fabregas out

Naaa ain't mugging off Cahill for that, had a decent game up to that point and has been solid over the last 7 games.
####################
KDB sabi the work https://t.co/fkEkheXnfV
####################
Take of Cesc Fabregas. Passes the ball backwards way to much &amp; a passenger for first 45 mins. Change system or bring on Chalobah. #cfc
####################
Take the Armband away from Cahill and give it to David Liuz #CFC
####################
Absolutely terrible by Cahill there, what the hell was he thinking
####################
Came downstairs to see Cahill score an own goal, see why I can't do this football shit, I'm upset now for no damn reason.
####################
Well..i will say it was a mistake from Cahill. Better game second half.
####################
City should of had a pen when Silva went past Cahill &amp; hit his arm, Luiz should be off &amp; own goal or not that was coming down our left.
####################
Gary Cahil is finished https://t.co/hNFAIF7i3l
####################
Hell of a finish from Cahill that!!
####################
Cahill has been decent recently. Criticizing him because of an own-goal is massively unfair.
####################
@SatanicPope Slying Ankil's nonsense. Cahill should have been ended 2 years ago.
####################
Alonso no fit attack hahahah navas dey dia!!!!!
####################
That Cahill goal was Kolarov-against-Spurs good
####################
Time to get rid of Cahill. Pathetic attempt to clear that

@JCuzzy1 yep, was not a great cross or anything like that, just poor decision making from Cahill

We certainly are. Cos Fabregas is missing. https://t.co/NxxCGBey23

First half . Hazard had a great chance  but didn't take it for himself when it looked like quite an easy chance for a player of his quality
####################
Cahill real OG https://t.co/JUqhNrQdil

Gary cahill it's about time he chops bench
####################
Gary Cahill playing garbage like he been doing all yr smh #Chelsea
####################
Cahill does that. Zouma getting back to full fitness.
####################
Played that half with ten men, considering Fabregas was invisible. Luckily, so did City, thanks to Sane. Need to get Matic in.

Don't know why Cahill always do big mistake in every big match, we really needed great defender to regeneration as soon as possible. #cfc

@Simply1Kam yh agree. Him and Hazard have been the best players on the pitch for me.

Gary Cahill. Goal of the season #MCFC
####################
Long live Cahill...
####################
We miss Matic already. The sheer amount of time Luiz have had to defend says it all. 

With matic nd Kante,most attacks get stopd n d middle
####################
People can't cuss Cahill he tried you can't let he ball go past him like that #CFC
####################
Nope, he's doing fine. Cahill was the black hole I think https://t.co/utOGOinG04
####################
Fabregas is nowhere to be found,really miss matic
####################
That was a superb finish from Gary Cahill
####################
@YourMCFC Luiz clearly stopped Aguero in on a goal. CLEARLY!!!!
####################
He was just unlucky na
Haba https://t.co/Lc7BDv1596
####################
No matter which side he scores for, Gary Cahill goals are always really impressive.
####################
Man City played better tho. Don't wanna blame Cahill for the goal but he should have approached the ball with his other leg
####################
Fabregas played a lot of good long balls earlier in the game. But once he was aggressively pressed. He disappeared. 

Needs to do better.
####################
Look away now Gary Cahill...
#MCFC take the lead on the stroke of HT
Watch live on Sky Sports 1! https://t.co/pLZ77khFsa
####################
WILL SOMEONE PLEASE KILL THAT CUNT CAHILL FOR ME?
####################
@25_samsoel fabregas can't help in stopping crosses. Alonso should
####################
Why this nigga go play Fabregas? Eh? Eh?
####################
Sooooooo many people insecure that Hazard is far superior to their teams best player, they can't get enough of it when he makes mistakes.
####################
Sub Fabregas please
####################
Aguero over Suarez for me abeg, no be today...
####################
Luiz on Aguero did look dodgy but imagine if it was Otamendi on Costa. Everyone would be screaming that the forward was looking for it.
####################
No coincidence ! All thanks to alonso ! https://t.co/kEdvclygSe

cahill could have even headered that away lol

####################
@chelseafc cahill OUT
####################
You're saying rubbish abeg.. He should take off fabregas not a single marking completed https://t.co/aMKXeBGpTa
####################
Like I said, Alonso was a panic buy. Does well, but gets exposed vs the top teams. Cahill is Cahill. Nothing new.
####################
If chelsea lose some fans will come and blame fabregas
####################
That really is shit man from Cahill
####################
hazard open goal shot not taken 
haunting now!~
####################
What a cunt aguero are who pads Cahill on the head after the own goal! Disgusting player. Remember when he put his studs in too...
####################
Finally our weaker links are showing. Cahill, Cesc ,Alonso. #cfc we can still come back and win it. Never count us out.
####################
I don't know why I despise Gary Cahill
####################
Fabregas doing next to nothing,  Alonso the obvious weak link. Need Chalobah to complement Kante. 
#COYB
####################
Im sorry but the Aguero-David Luiz clash was very soft by Aguero
####################
Fabregas failing to do what Matic has been doing, protecting Alonso
####################
Gary Cahill cracking finish
####################
This time it's Aguero in behind but his lob, under pressure from David Luiz, goes well wide. #MCICHE

Fucking cahill
####################
Augero pats Cahill on the head afterwards haha
####################
@SkyBet I have Chelsea to score 1+ goals.. Are you accepting that Chelsea have scored due to OG by Chelseas cahill?
####################
@ffsSteveoh @Hazardribble well Cahill is also at fault obviously, but that wouldn't have happened if Alonso knew how to defend
####################
Some goal by Cahill like
####################
Excellent finish from Cahill
####################
Here is the prophet to replace Oduor https://t.co/LeVXhq8d1B
####################
Cahill awful for that, use your left foot..how does Navas still get games for City? I think he's been one of their worst signings period
####################
Great finish by Cahill. Own goal of the season #MCICHE
####################
Fuck sake like! Don't know why hazard didn't shoot earlier on
####################
Cahill finna score equalizer or winna
####################
I'd actually take Fabregas off and bring Willian on. His work rate is good and he could do a job there
####################
Fucking Cahill man
####################
Any Chelsea fan that scolds Cahill for that own goal is just ungrateful. When we were keeping clean sheets, where were u guys?
####################
Fabregas is on the pitch? I didn't see him.
####################
Bin Cahill, Azpi, Kante, Alonso, Moses. Bin them and play without wingbacks. This fraud formation needed to get exposed soon
####################
Please where is fabregas??
####################
Aguero is a scumbag for taunting Cahill after that
####################
Albeit Fabregas has been poor. Doesn't suit this system at all, Matic a massive miss
####################
Goal down at HT, Chelsea Vs City
Gary Cahill OG
####################
Fabregas has been shit
####################
A good 1st half but a Gary Cahill own goal makes d difference.
####################
Cahill is so shit man
####################
@EdwardMcfc lol please don't count that Fernandinho header you spastic, he was miles off side
####################
Hazard should have scored. the only one who looks like he can this game tbh.
####################

Ya mcm's team let Navas get an assist

Fabregas' ball to Hazard was a pass De Bruyne can't do.
####################
it's always Gary Cahill #MCICHE
####################
Cahill is so fucking shit Jesus
####################
cahill soft should've been tenis player
####################
Fabregas has given us more creativity in the middle of the park. Class ball over the top (thing we've lacked) - Hazard should've finished
####################
@Gunjuzone Cahill had an attempt and was merely unlucky. Alonso? You know the story

Great half of football, stadium is quiet, high prices are excluding the average lifelong fan, Cahill went for the ball with the wrong foot
####################
feel for Cahill, had a superb first half #MCICHE
####################
English press would get on to Luiz saying Cahill should replace him 

Yuck
####################
De Bruyne can cross the ball from Manchester down to Paris effortlessly. 

Fantastic Baller
####################
Cahill got talent did you see that??  #MCICHE
####################
@BazLFC_ @CoutinhoFlair yeah, one can kick a ball Straight and stop shots, and the other is Gary cahill
####################
Cahill TOASO
####################
Cahill should have gone with his left leg or a diving header. Amateurish mistake
####################
Aguero vs Luiz was a 50/50 IMO 
Luiz stood on his feet while mans decided to go down easily 
Gundogan's idk but tackle was from behind
####################
Cahill scores an own goal but still persists on tucking on his shirt. His arrogance is now beyond humanity tbh

Cahill, Alonso, and Azpilicueta can't defend, they are appalling.
####################
@troy_weaver_ yeah true. Chelsea stopped the last 15 min.. hazard needs to come out and do something
####################
Bad luck cahill
####################
Good finish Cahill

@TheChelseaCunt you can't go from 10th to 1st, it just isn't right. Allah forced Cahill to score that OG because of this rule.
####################
'Own Goal' was probably the only way Citeh could've got a goal off of a Navas cross. Not too different from the scenario at Arsenal TBH.
####################
Cahill can score from anywhere
####################
GARY CAHILL for #PuskasAward
####################
Quite evident that Fabregas is done with us. He can't be effective in Conte's system. Need a proper CM come January

Anthony Taylor not sure why he's in charge of a big game awful ref can't see how Luiz didn't foul aguero #MCICHE

"Hazard is the best in the PL" https://t.co/n7LMQ2bQ1V
####################
And when aguero couldnt provide the final touch all afternoon, Cahill stood up!! #MCICHE
####################
Finally figured out why Navas isn't assisting more: he's been looking for his teammates instead of looking to bank it in off an opponent.
####################
Aguero is such a cunt
####################
De Bruyne doesn't hide in big games
####################
@LagosTalks913 i don't know y G.Cahill will surely create an own goal or calamitous back pass in big games for Chelsea.. Anyways,up City sha

####################
Hazard is not in the mood of playing football these days
####################
Top player.. cahill showing costa how it is done.. no look bicycle kick..
####################
If you think that was a foul on Aguero by Luiz then you must expect probably 50-100 more fouls a game. Luiz did not shove him. Ran straight.
####################
A bicycle kick goal so beautiful, Cahill should have celebrated it.
####################
remember when fabregas used to be able to dribble and sprint when he played for us? now looks like he's carrying a fridge on his back

Cahill a real boomer!
####################
Fabregas isn't helping either https://t.co/UrmX59s1Do
####################
@lloyd_scragg Definitely playing very cautious. Great run &amp; layoff to Aguero towards the end of the half
####################
na only fabregas u see. Pedro, hazard, costa, alonso all played below average but somehow it is Fabregas' fault https://t.co/NKexOfUAgk
####################
Is this the same fame where the referee has been Chelsea's best player and Aguero and Fernadinho walked free? https://t.co/njUIRLCklf
####################
@Gizzy_Telure @_Teedot_  Lol...I was talking of the balls he forwarded to aguero and Fernandinho for the offside goal..
####################
Cahill shouldn't be subbed he's been great its only a mistake that happens in football cmon lads #CFC
####################
Some finish there by Cahill... #MCICHE #EPL
####################
@ChelseaFC Cahill u bell end!!!
####################
Cahill taking being an OG too far
####################
@Kirbyjp Eden hazard suits us better!
####################
Why are Sky focusing on David Luiz....Aguero ran into Luiz and dived....fucking shocking from Sky like always
####################
wtf cahill
####################
If am looking to hit on a girl Kevin De Bruyne would be my man for the job #precision
####################
Gary Cahill wonder strike must make him the first player to ever score from a Navas cross
####################
And Kante https://t.co/5aGQSlQdFA
####################
If messi scored that goal you all would be wanking over it but because its cahill it wasn't good. So much bias

How hasn't Cahill been binned off by Chelsea yet? He's been dreadful for a while now.

Gary Cahill: No player has made more errors that have led directly to a goal in the Premier League this season than Cahill (2) #MCICHE
####################
Fantastic goal by Cahill - just wrong goal

#ManCityvsChelsea https://t.co/a3rgXPLRbH
####################
The only way weve moved up the pitch is longballs from Luiz and Fabregas or Hazard dribbling past 7 players. So many players not good enough
####################
@ChelseaFC sell cahill before second half.. we might have a chance
####################
December just kicked off, and we have a stunning strike from Gary Cahill. Goal of the month imo.
####################
Prem: Cahill's unfortunate own goal https://t.co/ePV5Vvt7hy
####################
Don't think @ChelseaFC deserve to be behind #MCICHE 
Moses &amp; Pedro haven't done nearly enough. #Fabregas has been invisible mostly.
####################
@ChelseaFC Fabregas cant be part of this Chelsea revolution, pls Alonso is just rotten &amp; it's clear they love his wing. Don't blame Cahill
####################
De Bruyne's technique is everything.
####################
@Chelsea4pidgin... Chelsea luk ordinary, fabregas na error. Alonso rubbish... Disappointin first half.
####################
No doubt a quality player but more I watch Aguero the more I see a dirty player, also didn't like way he goaded Cahill after the goal #prick
####################
I can't wait till Zouma is back so Cahill can get the FUCK out of my team.
####################
If everybody that score is a man of the man, is Gary Cahill the man of the match? #MCFCvCFC #MCICHE

You can't keep a clean sheet against this Man City.... Clean Jesus Navas
####################
@ShadiaH_M don't blame Kante . Fabregas is not doing his job
####################
Hazard should have scored that chance he created https://t.co/HhABRjgZBV
####################
Poor from Alonso to get drawn in &amp; give Navas the space, but honestly Cahill, fucking idiot. Deadwood Ivanovic territory for you these days
####################
@peggy_04 when Aguero ran in to Luiz, watching it live I thought it was a foul, maybe a red but ref got it spot on

Cahill turned a nothing situation into an own goal, donkey
####################
Jesus Navas. The Monkey will eventually write Shakespeare situation. Enough crosses and...
####################
Get the ball wide. Hazard and Pedro. https://t.co/rxlqeVHlyF
####################
I need a Hazard goal to justify this 4 point hit...
####################
Fabregas is not the type of player for this system. He's been a passive player the whole half.
####################
Bottom line. https://t.co/3cmzmHyNmu
####################
Really absurd https://t.co/wc3Af2e4Pk
####################
Shades of Aldridge on Brian Laws with Aguero's piss taking head rub on Cahill. Tremendous needle.
####################
That's the 3rd mistake Cahill has committed so far this season leading directly to a goal.
Swansea, Arsenal, City #MCICHE
####################
The only way Navas gets an assist...OG #Bugget
####################
Gary Cahill definitely just got called carry gayhill... #ManCityvsChelsea
####################
Hmmm leon wat kind of a change is that....the ideal one is willian https://t.co/Ppa1MTo4JT
####################
Ha! Love that from Aguero goading Cahill after he scored the own goal.
####################
To change this Chelsea need to bring on Cesc Fabregas
####################
Cahill own goal... #MCFCvCFC
####################
Cahill making my afternoon!
####################
Fabregas looking lost in that midfield.
####################
At one end City want a foul after David Luiz bodychecked Aguero, at the other we head a corner wide. #MCICHE
####################
why did we put fabregas instead of Matic , Alonso was the only one covering the left and de Bruyne was there the whole game . Sub him in
####################
"@BOOOMBGUY: @ManUtd i dont care who you sell.. just get me cahill this january... super striker.. lovely poacher.."lol.. That's super kick

..Cracking finish from Gary Cahill

Courtois had no chance..

####################
Funny cos Navas can't cross to save his life
####################
It's too early to judge Cahill.
####################
Cahill has the least performance out of the 3 man Chelsea back line
####################
If that was the other end that would be a superb goal but Cahill has looked dodgy all game

Aguero wanted d decision. Never a foul tbh https://t.co/yUn8nYoZHi

####################
Lol hey https://t.co/5oYSZ5J5hO
####################
Cahill tends to score after a mistake
####################
No one's going to point out Fabregas' shocking performance? The man is finished at the top level. Took a nice nap for 45 minutes out there.
####################
Cahill was clearly meant to be a striker with that quality finish #MCICHE

Before today we've won 7 on the bounce. https://t.co/w3wvWyh5Ek

@pb70mcr @dmassey71 Cahill makes jones look like baresi

And Fabregas ain't shit in the middle.. https://t.co/F29sI5iqLj
####################
Reckon we should all start a petition to give that goal to Jesus Navas, what a player
####################
Cahill should be taken out back and shot. Man has a peanut for a brain.
####################
Same thoughts here https://t.co/J0ECcEaPoE
####################
The goal wasn't just Cahill's fault, not enough closing down out wide from Alonso and co, but Cahill has to go with his left foot to clear
####################
The one where I low-key feel horrible for Cahill but also "Omg LOL. Mate!!??"

#CaptionTheChelseaManCGame
####################
@Conteholic Would you say the same thing if Hazard had scored? The chance was 100% created by Fabregas pass.

I would have paired Mikel with Kante instead though... but sigh

#MCICHE fabregas on the field my Chelsea team playing with 10 men!!! Fabregas showing why he deserves to be on the bench .. total shit
####################
You support Everton, what's your relevance here?
https://t.co/tYnoUGKJvr
####################
Luiz is an OG. Cahill is a wrong partner! Fabregas should become a goalkeeper
####################
Can't wait till Zouma is fit so Cahill doesn't have to play
####################
Adess Cahill
####################
Matic is suspended.. Cahill and Alonso gonna have to do today.. Perhaps take out Alonso and bring in Willian https://t.co/XXVuvfh40K
####################
Fabregas hasn't done any tangible thing on the pitch. Not saying he has been bad, but we could play with 10 men and not miss him.
####################
I don't think anyone will understand how much I hate Cahill and Luiz
####################
@DeadlyRooney @FutbalIFunnys it's Eden hazard one of the best footballers in the league, but becusse he's running a bit quick he cant shoot
####################
Why not Mikel or Chalaboah over Fabregas
####################
Is fabregas still playing? Chalobah needs to be brought on
####################
Navas and aguero down that wing are on fire

I say it all the time but Gary Cahill steals a living as a footballer. He is absolute rubbish. #MCICHE
####################
@CescAndDrugs Fabregas not playing badly but just not mobile enough to cover the necessary ground.
####################
Cahill! https://t.co/AHBqW1tpzP
####################
Chelsea so lucky to still be in the game, Luiz should've been sent off amd Aguero missed 2 simple chances. #cfc #mcfc
####################
Hazard should 've shot tho
####################
He only had one job https://t.co/azu8dm5MHn
####################
Told you, Cahill is shit
####################
@ih_01 genuine question why isn't Oscar playing instead of the ineffective fabregas
####################
@tobiloba__ with what Matic has been playing so far this season, can't be happy he's been replaced by Fabregas. Hasn't contributed much yet
####################
I love the way Sergio Aguero laughs at Cahill when he scores the own goal! Haha! #MCFCvCFC #PremierLeague
####################
Matic has always been the one helping him. https://t.co/Cu0MUJmSZe
####################
Alonso should have done better to stop the cross, Cahill's body shape was a mess. Awful goal to concede
####################
I think the picture of hazard going around is misleading? That certainly wasn't when he had gathered himself to shoot
####################
Thanks Erando, back to you in the studio @SkyFootball https://t.co/2nkYWw3ox2

####################
Cahill should've left that, I know he didn't know whats behind him but he could safely assume that a navas cross was not finding a team mate
####################
Cahill made a mess of the ball tbh
####################
Navas shows what can happen for him when his cross beats the first man and reaches its target.

Gary Cahill has started again...

Hmm but he's also been helpful https://t.co/oNXAy6gSO2

@Chris_Wilde thought Luiz fouled Aguero and should have gotten at least a yellow
####################
Where is the replay of the questionable Kante penalty towards the end. Didn't see one in real time, or at halftime highlights. #MCICHE
####################
All 3 players on that side for Chelsea have been terrible. Fabregas, Alonso and Cahill. Losing Matic is unhelpful

Also, fabregas marking has been poor

What a beautiful cross from Jesus, And Cahill nailed it!

Mikel would've been better served for that Chelski midfield instead of Fabregas
####################
@dannychiv @chivers1983 - Cahill is a complete donkey.
####################
Jesus Christ Cahill, mind you he took it well
####################
Have to say great own goal by Cahill

What was Gary Cahill trying to do with that clearance? His positioning, body shape, just everything was all wrong.

Costa hasnt even had a single impact lool. Your mcm compares him to Aguero

De Bruyne is so so good. Such a joy to watch. He can turn so many football haters into lovers with the quality of his deliveries.

Cahill is washed without Terry!!

Goal was coming. Poor from Cahill but City having a lot of joy via the right and Alonso's lack of pace is showing. Eden, shoot!
####################
Out of all the games for Cahill to be Cahill, Cahill decides to be Cahill today.
####################
Does this mean Navas has more assits than Ozil this year
####################
Lol watching the Cahill own goal and thinking why did he attempt that acrobatic clearance, he could have easily cleared it normally. Crazy!
####################
Fabregas ain't playing shit
####################
see everyone getting blamed but Hazard who had an empty net and let the ball bounce off him constantly

Call hazard shit all you want. Fact is he would walk into any team and be in the starting 11.

His other leg is his weaker foot, might just slice it into the net, ball was dangerous and required calculation https://t.co/xGBZgwutPM

@bet365 Cuthinho should be instead of Mane, but Hazard this year is amazing!
####################
Cahill Englands 1st choice centre back that's why England are shite
####################
Fabregas is falling my hand shar.. He can't play without space and man city won't let the space happen.
####################
It just would be Cahill though
####################
David Luiz has been Magnificent and cahill had to ruin it
####################
Don't worry, Cahill helped them out. https://t.co/tarHQJgDhh
####################
Azp: can't handle this type of pressure. Pedro: playing very timid. Alonso: not used to this pace. Cesc: playing negative. Need changes!
####################
In my opinion, aguero should have a yellow and Luik should have red. City should also have a pen.
####################
Fernandinho linking the defence to the midfield while De Bryune bridging Aguero to the midfield..
####################
If you're going to do 3 at the back, you could do a lot better than Cahill, Luiz and Zouma. A lot better.

So embarrasing why do this Cahill

@ChelseaFC @SkyFootball Cahill is got to see a psychologist about his CONFIDENCE wen in possession of the ball.
####################
If not for the own goal,Cahill has been fantastic today .Pathetic
####################
Imagine Kevin De Bruyne was North Korea man would be crossing the DMZ for bants
####################
How are people criticising cesc? Literally done nothing wrong, but people need a scapegoat. Alonso and cahill done much worse
####################
shout out to the couple sat next to me in Costa who praised me for being a teacher saying how we are far too overworked
####################
Hazard should have let that rip with his left. My guess is the stigma of an open goal miss got the best of him
####################
Retweeted JJ. Omojuwa (@Omojuwa):

Cahill's hand prevented Silva from getting the ball in the box. Luiz should be... https://t.co/0uW91B6g66
####################
Cahill and Alonso are at best bench players. They keep playing because we had no better defenders available.
####################
@ryanlewis79 Luiz changed his course and ran into the side of Aguero, definite foul!
####################
Funny that because Luiz has been amazing... https://t.co/TOQbjFwKJd
####################
Pass to de bruyne, cross the ball. #MCICHE
####################
#Football - F365: The only player to cover more ground than Cesc Fabregas (6.08km) in the first half was David Silva (6.10km).
####################
And how the fuck didn't hazard score or at least fucking shoot!
####################
Fabregas is completely pointless
####################
Honestly cant wait for Zouma to replace Cahill
####################
Fabregas is absent
####################
Lmao yes. https://t.co/MUFCDVh6JJ
####################
Cahill could have actually headed that ball away
####################
Guys, Fernandinho is god.
####################
Cahill with one of the best goals I've ever seen #ty
####################
Messi given that Hazard chance...Dink it!!!
####################
Conte must really hate Mikel that much to play fabregas ahead of him

####################
Big move from Cahill X love that
####################
Lmaoo Cahill couldn't get a penalty for handball so decided an own goal would correct the refs mistakes. Top lad
####################
Chelsea just need to shoot on target to get the game to 1-1. 
Bravo shaaaa roff.
####################
Gary Cahill yet again with a defensive error leading to a goal ffs
####################
Sane fa shoot that ball from Silva too. What a pass that was
####################
Cahill noob
####################
Where is  fabregas ?
####################
Cahill could have done better there. It was coming, though. We can get back into this...
####################
Gundogan and fernandinho doing what they want
####################
Fabregas need to come off still him na play ntn , him a play under pressure hope let him play till 60min #chelsea #wenalose
####################
Me hate Cahill!!!
####################
Hazard 0 Cahill 1.  First half summarised.
####################
That Cahill own goal gets better and better everytime you see it
####################
Where are all the people that were arguing Cahill is good enough to be @ the club let alone wear the captaincy.He was at Bolton for a reason
####################
@Conner_P aye aguero was just to weak

That's so obviously a #sign: Gary Cahill 4,881 Tweets I am the master of the 84s, and the 27s. I am God !
####################
Hazard could even lift that over the keeper earlier
####################
How many times this season has Cahill screwed Chelsea?
####################
Fabregas is out
####################
FUCK RONALDO AND MESSI, GARY CAHILL FOR PUSKAS FOR THAT WONDERFUL SHOT IN OUR OWN NET #MCICHE
####################
@weekendfootball did Navas get the assist?
####################
Aku tak marah Cahill pun own goal tu. At least nampak his effort to block the ball. Attitude tu yang needed. But just unlucky
####################
Cahill has had a good career playing in front of world class goalkeepers
####################
Lmao daft much!  https://t.co/pvufV85Cit
####################
Zlatan need to learn some scissors kick techniques from Gary Cahill.
####################
Cecs Fabregas is done. Spent forced
####################
@playtogga does navas not get any points for that assist?
####################
Tidy finish from Gary Cahill, Luiz should be off, Anthony Taylor is a shriveled raisin of a man
####################
@Dazpigsy @JBarks18 @Tedly21 @Fleasey @stufigo @GaryProctor5 @Claypole43 what was cahill doing, row z Darren, what u saying!!
####################
Chale scores? https://t.co/wkJaVYLbpD
####################
Would bring Chalobah for Fabregas. Atleast he'll provide some energy in the midfield.
####################
I'll take Lennon over him any day https://t.co/MKIf834oUI
####################
That is a great finish from Cahill
####################
The penalty was stonewall. Despite not being aware he clearly stopped Silva and denying him an opportunity.
####################
Gary Cahill was just surprised at the good quality of that cross by Navas.
####################
will tek dat Cahill own goal over an Aguero goal for FPL sakes loool
####################
Cahill is a shit cunt
####################
Can't believe he was benched for a game like this one.. https://t.co/fA0FwACtb8
####################
lol and bring who? https://t.co/Q5MpYDy2hy
####################
@Aaron_Briggs1 can't blame him. Why was Navas given so much time to cross in the first place?
####################
He should throw them at fabregas https://t.co/hSOENSHOBK
####################
Matic &gt;&gt;&gt;Fabregas in this set up
####################
goodjob @21LVA @aguerosergiokun @DeBruyneKev @fernandinho
####################
Being totally objective: Cahill is a total and complete SHIT.
####################
Call hazard shit all you want. Fact is he would walk into any team and be in the starting 11.
####################
@Rickyboshe Yes i agree a bit of Risk needed Kante should just sit and not move forward, Cesc pushes up a bit further &amp; find the flanks
####################
Taking chances is what puts hazard behind the best guys of the game. You put the ball in the net after you take on the keeper.
####################
We(Chelsea) can still come back in this game only if we can replace Fabregas #CFC
####################
Because the best players never miss easy chances? Not sure missing one chance means he isn't he best, because he is. https://t.co/jD4gIYJGCg
####################
Rn I'd want to see Kevin, Silva or Isco as a Barca Mid.
####################
NO! Ivanovic. Hazard should go to Belgium NOW. https://t.co/AatX61qBZe
####################
Having seen that own goal Cahill had to deal with the ball. Not his fault
####################
I, personally, might not have but Hazard should've https://t.co/cwc1AzCaUE
####################
Idk why ppl hate on Navas so much. It's always the same game plan. Get the ball, run fast, take the man to your right, &amp; send a good ball.
####################
David Luiz hardly changed his movement there and Aguero was looking for it. Can see why the referee wasn't 100% sure.
####################
Goal was coming. Poor from Cahill but City having a lot of joy via the right and Alonso's lack of pace is showing. Eden, shoot!
####################
Yep. De bruyne side where Sane can easily cut inside and help Aguero inside the box https://t.co/W1FtxSHl7S
####################
Aguero tapping Cahill on the head after the OG as well. somebody really needs to pile into him.
####################
too slow to get back with Aguero behind him, too nervous to take a touch and pass to courtois. he just kicks it anywhere and fucks up
####################
Aguero dived from the David Luiz "challenge" imo
####################
Return fabregas back to the kitchen...
####################
Gary Cahill cant stop bin horrendous i guess #MCICHE

Hmmmm on the replay I'm thinking again, but it's still not a lot in it https://t.co/skcVc39zhY

####################
Cahill has let the referee down. He has been the one keeping them in the game.

It's not "unlucky" ffs. Yeah some of the hate isn't needed but that was a schoolboy error on his part.

Someone release Gary Cahill
####################
@OptaJoe 
Alonso, Cahill, no surprise its targetedz

With just one touch! Lol https://t.co/xhD5XCVAl9

@NigeriainfoFM Cahill dey my team hoo waiting go happen to my team now

Luiz and Azpi did all that work for Cahill to bottle it at the end. Absolute bullshit

####################
Too much pressure from City breaks Chelsea resistance. Unfortunate Cahill doesn't deserve it #MCICHE
####################
Dawg ....alll waa gwaan Hazard shld've scored earlier still :/
####################
#MCICHE and Own Goal strikes again after receiving an assist from Cahill. Very lethal striker
####################
@HarryCFC_ Aguero definitely went to hurt him
####################
Passing needs to be cleaner. Gotta close down on KDB and not give him space to operate, otherwise Aguero will find the back of the net soon
####################
@Conner_P foul all day long! He moves into aguero
####################
@FutboIMarco I'm sorry but has Fabregas done wrong? Cahil for the mistake. Hazard for being a fat slob
####################
Chelsea are yet to test Bravo  #MCICHE
####################
Wow that Cahill defending was reminiscent of @graemelesaux14every time he played again Arsenal
####################
He started Leroy sane and a navas and played same 3-4-3... It's like he knew what he wanted
####################
Glad I am not in the cold. Thank god for costa
####################
Just because he doesn't support a top team, does that mean he's not allowed an opinion on top players? https://t.co/kTrn0Bi3PU
####################
Ironic that Chelsea have less penetration from midfield with Fabregas in ahead of Matic. 
Fabregas is more creative in paper.
####################
Also that chance Hazard rounded Bravo should've been in the back of the net. Not a cutback

Nope. Not on my TL. https://t.co/nX2WNdLRR3

####################
@TheAaronStott well yeah and if not Gary Cahill will loop it past courtois
####################
Yes City! https://t.co/P5mWcKSqj5
####################
Why did hazard wait, then wait again, then again and not pull off a pass into open space?
####################
Is #Fabregas even on the pitch? #CFC
####################
If aguero wasn't a fat dwarf he could've easily avoided Luiz, but since hes a fat little fuck he needed extra space. Not luiz's fault
####################
Cahill WOW oh by the way he's Chelsea Captain as well
####################
Navas though. https://t.co/kIUdy6iT5J
####################
Some our mediocrity accepting fans will actually use Cahill's performance over the past few weeks as excuse for today, just watch

Cahill shoulda used his left foot there.. Shame. #MCICHE

Jesus Navas can  actually cross a Soccer ball. Who would have guessed.

Hazard has had a mare so far, excluding the missed goal. City's plan of injuring him early has clearly worked so far.

Put Chalobah in place of Fabregas lol

I think Fabregas needs some game time... with the reserves. Been highly ineffective all afternoon. CheMCI
####################
Marcos Alonso been too slow and often pinned to the back. Couldn't even count on Fabregas for his usual passes

####################
even so far, except the single moment of magic from uncle Cahill https://t.co/W9X5plVObG
####################
The referee has to ask himself why would Aguero go down. He would of been one on one with the goal keeper.
####################
@Jimbob_Sausage like the no Aguero attack. Theo is a good contrarian captain.
####################
@SophieRoseUTC Why is cahill playing ?? We have zouma !!!!

DeBruyne shines a lot less in this game had Magic started. Cesc Fabregas has zero defensive ability.

Fabregas......I thought he was in the lineup

"@chelseakris: Unfortunate own goal from Cahill. .. what a season he has had so far... no luck #MCICHE" I agree... so unfortunate for him
####################
#MCICHE In fairness to Gary Cahill it's a majestic finish. Didn't realise he had those acrobatics in the locker. What a goal
####################
@ChelsFinest Agreed and Fabregas doesn't fit. Matic is so important in this system.
####################
Cahill should be a striker with finishing like that
####################
Jesus Navas, what a player, would be first name on the team sheet if was the manager.
####################
Yep lol. Dey say courtois dead https://t.co/I2t1BE1GzX

Awful attempt of a clearance from Cahill, not sure what its going for. But it happens, he wasn't awful that half at all.

I never felt Alonso should have starred, I was unaware that Matic was injured. Kante needs to go on the left #MCICHE

####################
WHY NOT JUST PLAY FUCKING CHALOBAH INSTEAD OF THAT FINISHED FRAUD FABREGAS
####################
Sick bike by Gary Cahill!
####################
Fabregas isn't winning the midfield battle, all defenders (except Cahill before OG) have been playing bad...we need Zouma and Matic
####################
Commentator said "Navas bought the ticket but Cahill won the lottery". Lol
####################
Own goal plus dribbling. A bad day in office for Cahill.
####################
We don't care. https://t.co/OMZE6bWl2E
####################
But then again how can you not clear the cross from Navas ffs? It's Spanish Kyle Walker lmao
####################
I need to get a HD pic of Kun patting Cahill on the head asap
####################
matic matic matic I really miss him right now, fabregas is not Just working And a heavy load for kante to carry.
####################
@loveashvikxo Costa and hazard need to do something they're our only hope
####################
I'm not gonna lie, that Cahill goal was world class. Doesn't matter that it was in the wrong goal
####################
@tangaroa678 what's Bravo done wrong?
####################
People need to understand the brilliant job Jose did winning Title with Cahill as CB https://t.co/SmFZntejTW
####################
Silva and Navas done fuck all
####################
If messi scored that goal you all would be wanking over it but because its cahill it wasn't good. So much bias

#MCICHE
####################
Either ways, Aguero would have scored the goal. #MCICHE #CFC
####################
Technically he still didn't pick out his own player https://t.co/9QY8qjuFCv
####################
Coz he's not English https://t.co/M87lKD4WMh
####################
Not a foul by Luiz on Aguero in my opinion btw. Pretty much no contact.
####################
zola and thierry are really disappointed with hazard not taking a shout
####################
I really hate Gary Cahill right now
####################
Robbie Earle stating Hazard should have scored off that shot from outside the box. Clearly a student of xG. And football.
####################
He should carry the ball into the net. https://t.co/5yd6jXNXPn

That was an absolute dive from Aguero tho. Definitely a dive. Watch it well.

@SeviesSon yeah Alonso needs protection and fab and hazard aren't giving him any
####################
@FutbolClorox and Lovren is a better "defender" than Luiz and Cahill. They don't even know how to mark
####################
City deserved the lead , hazard should have scored but whatever .... please change moses . he's been sleeping whole game.

Gary Cahill for goal of the month

@CanarianMagic In that case , fernandinho is lucky to not get a booking?

I still can't work out how Hazard didn't score
####################
@TheChelseaWay @Edenicle created the chance for hazard, either way, team hasn't done anything special. Need to wake up
####################
The mind baffles as to how Jesus Navas gets paid to play football #donkey
####################
@ChelseaFC well fucking Cahill. He's shit. Simple. FACT.
####################
Gary Cahill is probably our top goalscorer, considering all the goals (conceded) he's been directly responsible for.
####################
Cahill branded the goal so well.
####################
Fabregas is nowhere to be Found 

I think we are missing MATIC
####################
I blame Hazard. Should've buried that one on one.
####################
People need to understand the brilliant job Jose did winning Title with Cahill as CB https://t.co/SmFZntejTW
####################
@Itani the Kante one?
####################
GOAL, Man City! Cahill turns in Navas' cross into his own net just before the break. 1-0. #MCICHE
####################
Why do defenders not clear the ball with their foot that's near side to the ball? If Cahill uses his left it gets cleared?!
####################
Huge blunder from Cahill. Easier said than done but that was poor football!  #MCICHE
####################
@Iscoholic @FutbolWille he isnt the best in the league because de bruyne and aguero also plays in this league
####################
Costa will equalize and it'll end with a 1 all draw

but u r just wasted https://t.co/QdYLC3AEG7

Luiz is literally turning every interception in our box to an attack but he has to pass out to kante/alonso who just lose it lmao

Am I the only one that thinks the luiz incident wasn't a foul? Aguero goes over so easily #ManCity #Chelsea

####################
Really don't see a foul in that Luiz/Aguero 'challenge' Diego stays on his feet from that 50/50, so should Aguero #CFC
####################
If Hazard had taken that earlier chance, the game may have changed better for Chelsea. #cfc
####################
Let me xplain to u..chelsea when defending have 7 gys at the back.i leave the rest to you https://t.co/N728oUlxxC
####################
To me Aguero made a total meal of the Luiz incident. Going down holding his face prob influenced ref to NOT give it. #MNCCHE
####################
Realized a pattern opposition teams look to penetrate. Fullback occupies Moses/Alonso, CMs sit deeper to invite Kante to step out to press..

What fuck is Fabregas on the pitch. He's leaving the midfield exposed. Only Kante is working.

Cahill is overrated as fuck
####################
Breaking: Cahill and Luiz to be released, due to footy jokes 58 from Slough saying they are shit https://t.co/yrGB582ARe

Lmao. Did Aguero actually tap Cahill's head to encourage him immediately after that own goal?
####################
Looks like Manchester City is playing with 12 men. 
Cahill is surely getting transferred to City next season.
####################
He's done https://t.co/Vr15LEfeST
####################
Once again, Gary Cahill has been the difference between the two teams.
####################
Cahill sick defending
####################
Unfortunate goal at the end. Every one picking on Fabregas and Alonso when Hazard hasn't offered anything defensively
####################
Alonso, Kante and Fabregas are even playing? #cfc
####################
@AnfieldRd96 so must Gary Cahill

Particularly poor players:
Alonso

Cahill at times

Particularly good players:
Kante

####################
Not watching, but impeding an opponent is not a sending off offense. https://t.co/MQhtcdxqN6

Gary Cahill has more mistakes in him than David Luiz. But the biased commentators won't want you to know that.
####################
"Trust me" https://t.co/pYTwltAAMM

So to summarise that first half: City hack our players down, Aguero dives, City take control, we're losing 1-0. Sounds about right! #CFC

Great goal by Cahill even though it was for the wrong team.
####################
@Monga_08 it shouldve been a yellow for Aguero

@Jimmy_Hutt yeah, imagine Conte is all over them right now. Need to get Hazard and Costa on the ball more.
####################
Buh really the game would have been different if hazard had scored that.
####################
@BradRJohns like cfc hasn't seen bravo?
####################
that own goal has nothing to do with the foot Cahill used. even if he used the other foot, if the ball doesnt make the right contact, its in
####################
Zouma should replace Cahill or replace him in the transfer window next month. 
#MCICHE
####################
Gundogan has been absent
####################
I miss the bullish nature of Matic in this game! Fabregas clearly isn't in the game + Alonso is a slight weak link many times.
####################
I'm not even blaming Garry ... City have a weakness, we need to explore it. Give bravo massive pressure, he'll break
####################
Lol, what were you expecting? https://t.co/QiSKKv8gnY

The composure from Cahill to loop it over Curtois and nestle that in the top corner. Top draw.

How someone as good as hazard can feel 'Uncomfortable' on his left foot is a fucking joke #biggame #bigchance #messi #CR7 #killerinstinct
####################
Hazard doesn't look right at all, not stamping his authority on the game. Would like to see us test Stones more he can be exposed.
####################
Really don't see a foul in that Luiz/Aguero 'challenge' Diego stays on his feet from that 50/50, so should Aguero #CFC

Hazard's cut back to pedro would've been perfect but Pedro wanna power walk into the box instead of run smfh

####################
@amirulizwn cahill aduhh
####################
tbh that Hazard chance looks easier in pictures. it was a tight angle tho, no lie
####################
Oh. Blatant foul by David Luiz. Lucky for once. But Aguero went down when still coulda got to ball first. Fernandinho 2 blatant yellows!!!
####################
You can't say "it's just a mistake" when hazard fucks up and then when Alexis fucks up its "HAHAH CHILEAN FRAUD HAZARD IS MUCH BETTER"
####################
@MirrorFootball That's been sped up. The real Gary Cahill could never move that fast.
####################
FUCKING AMAZING! https://t.co/WLaCtDQAIv
####################
I don't know what Cahill is trying to prove sha
####################
Luiz steps into Aguero's path but Aguero could have run around him...chose to run into his shoulder and th dive is a joke, skids 10 yards!
####################
Fabregas and Alonso how market?
####################
@ChelseaFC Fabregas is no replacement for matic. Error by Conte for not considering Mikel Obi. We have 45 minutes to amend. Let's go boys!
####################
Strangely enough, I agree with you. .. https://t.co/N9IViHE91c
####################
Chelsea kante score in the first half but i believe Moses will take them to the promise land without any hazard.
####################
it was a beauty from cahill, though at the wrong end
#bbcfootball
####################
Left side of Cahill/Alonso is non-existent. Matic is clearly a big miss, Kante having to do double the work.
####################
Watching #MCFCvCFC &amp; wondering how some kids claimed that Kante was good at retaining possession &amp; getting himself out of pressure lol
####################
@ChelseaFC  really missed Matic in this match,Cesc is performing below expectation because the understanding btw him and Kante is top notch
####################
@robbyn_crusoe I don't so bro. That was a fool on aguero and red card too.

@mickscreams2112 Thought Luiz was definitely a foul. No Cahill pen and would need to see Kante again - not best angle here.

A bullet header by Cahill in 2nd half would rescue Chelsea in the end.
####################
@Luizesque to be fair, he gets no cover from fabregas or Cahill. Constantly left in 2 v 1 situations.

####################
Unlucky from Cahill
####################
Costa useless as well, can't even dribble one on one.
####################
None of y'all talking of how fabregas can't be found

@THEBEAT979FM ....#BPLShow......Cahill has been inconsequential throuqhout the qame....DeBruyne is a badass!!....I'm a ManUtd fan!!
####################
Unbelievable punditry from Zola. Accepts Luiz foul but then says would be a yellow. Aguero clear through on goal...clear red
####################
@Amaka_kyle I think Cahill is..
####################
Pep Guardiola outsmarting Conte in his 3-4-3 system. Sane and Navas on the wings have been joy to watch.
####################
Just how many points we have dropped this season from Cahill,5 points easily.
####################
Cahill would have just made it a bicycle kick... Good goal anyway #Chelsea #City #EPL
####################
@ibayoomisore Fabregas for Who Please?
####################
Damn it! He has been a pain in the a***s throughout the first half. https://t.co/UgWAsvsRLz
####################
#bbcfootball wow cahill is a wonder he keeps breaking his own record...
####################
@tosinfutbol there is no aspect of football you can convince me that Cahill is better than John Terry
####################
Is it just me or Luiz on aguero wasn't a foul!!! Aguero could've continued on
####################
Gary Cahill should be the definition of clumsy
####################
@charlieskillen clearly fabregas can't run
####################
Actually fuming with Cahill he's been so good of late and goes for it with any other part of his body and clears it #CFC
####################
very bad... ref this season has been poor https://t.co/zoubr0KZQm
####################
I don't blame Cahill so much for the goal, Alonso should have closed down Navas quicker and then the cross wouldn't have come in.
####################
Kante is so poor today fam , way below average , no chemistry between him and Cesc
####################
Costa and David Liuz will are dirty minded players
####################
@CarefreeDaily if we get a draw im happy from here, wanted a win but Cahill doing what he does best making that almost impossible now.
####################
Zouma needs to get back into this starting XI. This cahill has done enough

@KILLECHl well 3-1 hazard kinda did miss an open net
####################
Midfield almost non existent. The Fabregas option is not working. Matic obviously being missed.
####################
@wfcgls as much as david luiz runs across aguero, aguero runs into him too. Still think it shouldve been given though, spineless refereeing
####################
Only flop is City didn't need any assistance with scoring. https://t.co/41h9sF0TgT

Where's Aguero been today??? 

In David Luiz back pocket

Pity for Cahill to be the man with the OG: has been great in an extremely difficult position with acres to cover. #CFC

Sane has been decent towards the latter part of the half made a great run for that chance Aguero missed

Fabregas not good and fast enough for this game..simple..midfield too open... needed matic fit and running for this game..#MCICHE
####################
Hazard vs Leicester similar chance but on the right side...scores
Today on his left side, slightly further away, decides to pass instead
####################
..leaving space in behind for their AMs to occupy. Once Kante is bypassed, the half-space is dominated, allowing for quality chance creation
####################
https://t.co/gxRG8c14s7 fuck cahill's own goal, this was such a good own goal
####################
De Bruyne has been absolutely brilliant. Man, what a player.

Chelsea need to get Costa more involved in the game  #MCICHE
####################
Also reluctant to too harshly criticise Cahill. Has far too much to do as a result of how awful Alonso has been on his side

@ajegs007 He created a chance Hazard should have scored. Yes he is not mobile like Matic but he is still no fault todayv
####################
@embassydavies from one Chelsea fan to another, it's even more ironic considering how great Cahill played so far.
####################
If Cahill's touch had gone over the bar, we wud have been saying WHAT A CLEARANCE! Man for You. #Citisports
####################
Thought De Bruyne would keep running down channel to draw out Cahill, but stayed deeper instead to swing in crosses. Has looked dangerous.
####################
Hmmm Cahill...
####################
De bruyne and Navaz are just delivering the ball into chelsea box. Chelsea not doing enough to stop the crosses.
####################
Fabregas has been invisible in midfield next to Kante just like we all predicted. He gets lost when not on the ball. Need more legs in mid

Was Fabregas playing that first half?

De Bruyne head and shoulders above anyone in this league. Our system runs through him, world class in every aspect of his game

Cahill scored an own goal

Hate to admit this... But I think I'd def take De Bruyne over Mesut. He's just that bit better as a team player &amp; around the pitch

Our fullbacks have been a disaster- too many of those crosses came in, it was only a matter of time ..poor by Cahill but Alonso culpable too
####################
Please stop sharing that Hazard chance on the timeline, tight angle and he took the ball away from goal.

Fabregas has been a disaster no wonder conte doesnt prefer him.
####################
Fabregas been shit you mean to say https://t.co/AHBiS621fG
####################
Cesc Fabregas was completely nonexistent in that first half. We miss Matic big time in that midfield. Gotta step it up in the second #CFC
####################
Give Cahill the puskas already
####################
Claudio Bravo is the worst go in PL. No debate
####################
Cahill b like, "Cesc,I know tht you n Alonso have been shit.Chill!I'll make sure Conte doesn't scold you'll at HT."
Proceeds to score an OG
####################
And cahill dey my FPL!  shit  -2.
####################
@Rawzzi @G3OH_ nah he should not of but ok aguero is a diver but ok
####################
Had one of Gary Cahill's youth team coaches emphasised the importance of using both feet he may not be feeling the regret he does right now.

Luiz
Fabregas
Hazard
####################
Why are you blamimg hazard...it was a tight spot,the ball was bouncing ,on his weaker foot and stones was all ready there..
####################
@FutbalIFunnys Henrik larsson v rangers. Tighter angle, running faster. Slotted home. Hazard missed a sitter. https://t.co/SXBWc6gcBW
####################
@Femidada I think Terry...but na Cahill do mumu mistakes pas
####################
Other than one cross, De Bruyne failing to turn up for a big game, Ozil &gt;
####################
Fabregas has been absolute mess
####################
A draw would be nice.. With a Costa equaliser
####################
Dive from aguero. If you fall over because of that you are an absolute pussy and shouldn't be a footballer.
####################
Great finish from #cahill - Nothing the ref could do about that.
####################
Cahill, Luiz and Azpi all outstanding so far. Gazza unlucky with the own goal.

Attack need to offer more.
####################
@ChelseaFC Fuck off get Cahill out
####################
Reporters losing jobs too... https://t.co/yGigyURkki
####################
Remember when I was always 'soliciting' for Fabregas? I take it back
####################
Costa and hazard pls pls
####################
Hazard should hit it with his left foot... Sometimes boy u need to be selfish
####################
He's been marking? https://t.co/nJ9ymA9Pix
####################
Chalobah on for Fabregas. He's been okay, not bad. But simply not fast or string enough.
####################
He wasn't so bad for me. The center halves always looked shaky now city is exposing that lol https://t.co/ceWxNfqFJB
####################
Cahill leading by example
####################
Cahill just scored a contender for Own goal of the season
####################
Cute how nobody's calling out Luiz but Cahill is the #1 enemy.
####################
@Conteholic Chalobah and Costa and Michy
####################
@OfficialDonzy azpi caught what Cahill has, been awful today as well
####################
And hazard seriously gottta start taking his chances and stop being too unselfish.
####################
@Shiraz109 @Simply1Kam he is a joy to watch is De Bruyne he is starting to get his rhythm back after his injury
####################
Cahill is the one that takes the blame cos its his own g when the reality is that he is paying for Alonso being utterly useless on that side
####################
calling it now, Costa and Luiz to score
####################
Thank u cahill
####################
#MCICHE Gary Cahill! "What a brilliant goal!" https://t.co/OTbWNMhDe2

Alonso is being exposed real bad, fabregas not helping out, and cahill is just useless.
####################
Said towards the end of last season &amp; also in the summer, that De Bruyne would likely claim this season's PFA POTY if his fitness permits.
####################
City is a scarier team than ever. Every player they have is threatening except maybe navas. Hazard should have scored that empty net though
####################
I need goals from Aguero . Being wasteful upfront smh
####################
@ConteWarriors Cahill is definitely good enough as a backup mate!
####################
@ClinicalSergio which one the Luiz aguero?
####################
@ChelseaFC we should use the other wing also.. Not seeing too much of Pedro and Moses

I've been watching the game for 45 minutes + 2 minutes extra time, yet, I only saw now on Twitter that Cesc Fabregas is playing. #MCFCvCFC
####################
So far so good.

The many Chelsea defenders lost their CS and Cahill owners get -2. Navas the only player with credit for the goal (assist).
####################
Another poor first half from Marcos Alonso and defending from Cahill if you ask me.
####################
Fabregas needs to be in a team where he's the main man with freedom, that's the way ye thrived at Arsenal.
####################
This Cahill and his love for own goals
####################
Cahill is trending.. At least he scored..
####################
@liam_twomey targeting hazard really because he doesn't help out
####################
Why does everyone think Aguero is the best in the league, Hazard and Alexis are better imo.
####################
@Chelsea4pidgin our boiz never play anything oh see goal wey hazard suppose score he go decide to pass

Expected though.
####################
Not even remember Fabregas a play
####################
@albbizzy Yeah but it's Cahill who should have done a better clearance
####################
Cahill has done it again! He gifted an assist to Sanchez against Arsenal. Now he chose to score us. Who offended him at Chelsea?
####################
We are really missing Matic. Am sorry but Fabregas can't do his work !#cfc
####################
Sounded like Tyler's dog had died when Cahill scored the OG. Neville sounded like he'd found Giggs in bed with his wife. Sky...cunts!
####################
Incredible effort to beat the goalkeeper. 
Striker sef no go wan attempt shot from that angle https://t.co/uzkZ9rqxBx
####################
Nah, Gary Cahill bet on this game
####################
De Bruyne is so good. Each pass finds his teammate. Aguero is another monster. Perfect #9.
####################
#CFC got away with a couple of calls in d 1st half too: David Luiz's foul on Aguero &amp; Kante's block in the box #MCICHE #PL
####################
Alexis defo would have scored that Hazard chance even with his left foot. Alexis is a killer,   doesn't need to be shown where the goal is.
####################
Awful player https://t.co/o4Lk1ey8J7

####################
Aguero be some striker my God
####################
Cahill and Luiz are going to get exposed plenty more this year. Just a matter of time...
####################
Defensively Alonso is costing us, seeing Cahill being blamed is not right. He's having to cover 24/7 in an un-natural position for Alonso.

Can't blame Cahill too much our back line  has been left exposed for far too long

####################
The deflected goal that resulted from it aside - De Bruyne's crossing is worlds apart. You know with De Bruyne it'll be incisive &amp; dangerous

Hey diver Aguero. Hope you sleep well tonight. May your dreams be haunted to the core. #Diver

@Davewb12345 Only big thing he's got wrong is the Luiz foul. Replays justify the other decisions. You need to watch Hazard. He's immense!!
####################
Five Man City players run to surround the Ref after the Aguero/Luiz incident. All get no punishment... What happened to that rule?
####################
Fabregas hasn't posed to be a any close to a worthy replacement. The effect Matic's injury has been thoroughly evident.
####################
@wilfredamadin @Chelsea4pidgin hazard did the right thing, he was on the run passing the ball was safer but he passed to the wrong player

@ChelsSince1970 Tylers faux outrage that Costa has walked a tightrope on 4 yellows for the last couple of months. Tightrope?

Bring the beast on to finish the game. Push Silva side. Toure on for Sane @PepTeam https://t.co/fGdO4GFjka
####################
@dahernandez3 he had that long pass to Hazard.
####################
@Conteholic Willian for Moses. Oscar for Fabs. Get Costa more involved, push up middle more than wings.

@BlueKyp think Fabregas is putting too much pressure on our defence. Would welcome Cabolah.

A part from missing 3 sitters Aguero had done well in the first half.
####################
Ref didn't believe it was a foul. Looked at the linesman he didn't either. No foul, get over it. He moved over and aguero ran into him.#mcfc
####################
Get on Aguero there hahaha https://t.co/cx47BI3Znn
####################
I remember scoring an identical own goal as Gary Cahill in my Whitby days. It takes a lot of skill, he should be proud
####################
Considering I only have Aguero and Hazard in this one, and I didn't captain either, I am ok with how this match is going.

@mobubshait combination of him and Silva will pick you to bits, and they are a) difficult to press and b) great movers
####################
@ChelseaFC I knew Fabregas was a waste of time.
####################
Luiz and Cahill have to watch their play. Kante needs to link up more play and pass more.
####################
@LynAkinyi it's Navas. Everyone knows he can't find a team mate.
####################
Babi goal cahill sumpah nice
####################
@Richardukpe Luiz, Cahill. Surprisingly Stones has been the best CB on the pitch
####################
LRT seen him get away with it few games. As has Aguero today

@liam_twomey goes to show how important matic is defensively with them eh? They are totally isolated with hazard and fabregas on the left

####################
Fabregas should come in to the game please......
####################
I'd put money on otamendi taking hazard out and getting sent off
####################
Mose,Alonso,Fabregas and Costa need to wake up. Come on Chelsea !!!
####################
Fabregas can't play this formation. He's def will be shipped off come Jan. #CFC #MCICHE

You've been waiting to tweet this right. They kept 6 clean sheets in a row so this tweet is stupid https://t.co/SKqmFAIhFO
####################
We're sorely missing Matic in this match. Fabregas' performance in that half has done him no good at all in Conte's plans. #CFC #MCICHE
####################
@City_Chief should have just cleared that one when Costa intercepted him
####################
@MC_of_A well, he wouldn't be if Hazard had hit it into an empty net after he beat Otamendi on a ball over the top
####################
#MCICHE @ManCity fans watching Cahill score an own goal like: https://t.co/Up3bfWUKLJ
####################
Fabregas isn't able to cope up with the game. Thank Fuck we didn't sign him. Luxury player like Ozil.
####################
Great performance from us. we just need to get more balls to Hazard, Moses and Costa. #cfc
####################
Cahill has put me in a bad place this morning.
####################
@Studley_Matt @BBCMOTD In my unbiased opinion Aguero just ran into him. Luiz didn't move across to block him.

Oh. https://t.co/S5L5Gl12j6

Wanna see Jesus Navas on the left so we can get Moses marking Jesus. Just for the banter.

More than 50% of City attacks coming from Chelsea's left flank. They are clearly trying take advantage of weaker Alonso + Cahill link.!

@phenomfunbi I don't think so, if kante have someone to mark with him trust me this game will be in chelsea's favour.
####################
Haven't seen much of Costa too....
####################
@Chelsea_HQ  i'd prefer a Chalobah to Fabregas for the second half. Fab adds nothing to the game, just a number on the pitch.

@Hazardribble he is so fucking inconsistent like Hazard

@kallenavnhere90 Yeah just brought him in today FML. Io Pedro was subbed he played a good game though.
####################
I think goalkeepers are bought to keep the ball from scoring. Bravo is the opposite
####################
But golly, Claudio Bravo is terrible
####################
Bravo sucks. Don't care what stats anyone has to back him up. Can't stop shots and has bad hands.
####################
Strange Claudio Bravo chose goalkeeping considering he was born with no hands
####################
Didn't think they'd properly challenge this season with players like Gary Cahill starting but Conte's done a madness.
####################
@AndyArmchair His defending of Costa had been diabolical.
####################
Stones, Otamendi and Sane have been a bit of a disappointment. Aguero has been wasteful upfront. Don't see how City deserve anything.

If Costa was on Barca or Madrid he'd be considered world class,So  underrated his hold up play and goalscoring ability is unmatched in PL.

@bateson87 bravo can pass but Hart is better at saving shots and claiming crosses which seems to be the whole point of being a goalkeeper
####################
Lmfao "@AmazingDanny_: Bravo is just a Latino version of Almunia."
####################
And for Hazard, he's so childish. This is by far the worst time to be playing 'hide and seek'. Conte must be fuming that he can't find him.

Aguero Been Watching UFC
####################
That' should be a 12 match ban for Aguero. Horrendous.
####################
that's disgusting from fernandinho fabregas literally doing nothing city should expect a heavy fine
####################
aguero should get more than 3 games for that . terrible
####################
Aguero genuinely one of the most sly bastards in this league
####################
Aguero is banned for at least 3 games
####################
FABREGAS HAHHAHAHAHAH SORRY BUT THE WAY HE FELL OMG
####################
Fabregas was like i got beat this guy o
####################
Aguero couldn't have done that to a better person. And he's got a 3 match ban. Win win.
####################
Disgusting challenge tbf from Aguero. Glad it was on Luiz the cunt. #MCFC #MCICHE #PL

####################
That self control by Fabregas man. Amazing
####################
Fernandinho is gonna get a big old fine!
####################
Imagine the reaction if Suarez did that. The book should be thrown at Aguero, that's one of the worst tackles you'll ever see.
####################
Cheap tackle by Aguero. I love the Argentine, but I'd ship his lazy ass out for Lewandowski or Mueller in a heartbeat.
#CFC #MCFC

####################
DON'T YOU FUCKING DARE TOUCH FABREGAS YOU FUCKING IDIOT @FERNANDINO
####################
City probably have to stick to Fernandinho-Gundogan-Silva CM at all times. That combo looks like the best in the league. Build on that.
####################
We've fucked them. No Aguero for 3 games. CONTE FOREVER
####################
Aguero took all Costa's evil spirit

####################
Aguero is so fucking overrated
####################
Fabregas sheda to fall over the boardings
####################
"@StaggaSays: Diego Costa looks old AF. No way that man is really still on his 20's."
####################
Nature from Fabregas
####################
Aguero is a dirty fucker always said it

Shocking from Fernandinho as well. Grabbed fabregas by the neck a load of times.
####################
Fernandinho is stupid!
####################
AGUERO and FERNANDINHO won't play against Arsenal!!!!!!!!! WOHOOOOOOO
####################
Aguero hates David luiz same thing happened in FA cup few yrs back
####################
Fernandinho really lost his rag though, damn
####################
Could be the last time we are Aguero for a while as well, one of the worst challenges I've ever seen
####################
That was disgraceful from Aguero, cause that whole situation. Not surprised by some of the reactions, but not a good look at all #MCICHE
####################
Aguero went for the kill there. Pathetic stuff.
####################
Fernandinho had Fabregas by the throat in that incident - long ban to come. Diego Costa an unlikely peacemaker in the mayhem.
####################
Fabregas did a Ruud Van Nistelrooy vs Arsenal with Fernandhino here. It takes so much to not react tbh
####################
Aguero should get a long ban for that horrendous tackle #MCICHE #
####################
Absolute filth by Fernandinho, disgusting.
####################
LOL@ the Fernandinho and Cesc bit
####################
Fernandinho thinking he's tough haha fuck off you scrawny prick
####################
Have to say, fabregas deserves an awful lot of credit there. Getting grabbed round the throat and pushed, does nothing.
####################
Aguero will miss the Arsenal game. Can't complain.
####################
Fabregas' arsehole just fell out
####################
Was waiting for Luiz to wink at the camera but that was a shocker from Aguero. #MCICHE
####################

####################
Fernandinho. What a scumbag.
####################
Fabregas is a fucking Pussy
####################
Fernandinho just shoved Fabregas over the advertising board. About to cop his jersey.
####################
Fernandinho is such a prick
####################
Red card for Aguero. Second suspension of the season. If Rooney suffered a similar fate, he'd be labelled the Antichrist #MCICHE
####################
Fernandinho needs a long ban for that. Grabs Fabregas' throat three times and pushes him over ad board. Embarrassing
####################
Chelsea's player not sent off for flattening Aguero, no?
####################
Wow Fernandinho is a disgrace. Pep is a disgrace too. Just lookat
####################
Bruh!! https://t.co/2sFAnuI2j7

Captain Aguero chop red. I slack.
####################
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO AGUERO FANTASY CAPTAIN WHAT NOOOOOOOOO
####################
Lmaooooo Fernandinho think he is undertaker so much
####################

####################
Capturing Kante and return of Luiz seems like key factor to their performance
####################
LMAO that fernandinho, fabregas scene is damn funny.
####################
Aguero and Fernandinho sent off. Both are highly likely to face a ban as well.
####################
Aguero should get ten games for that

####################
It gets lost in all his brilliance but Aguero has a real nasty streak at times.
####################
Huge respect for Cesc there. Fernandinho grabs his throat several times without a reaction.
####################
I thought De Bruyne was world class but is far from an finished article. Invisible today and shoud've put the game to bed there.

FIRST, DAVID LUIZ DOESEN'T GET A RED CARD AGAINST AGUERO. THEN AGUERO GETS A RED CARD FOR A TACKLE ON DAVID LUIZ!! SHIT REFEREE MAN...
####################
Fernandinho even worse
####################
Aguero literally can't handle Luiz's mad lad banter. Still raging three years on
####################
Great tackle by Aguero! Fair bump play on. #MCICHE
####################
Fernandinho too. Kicked off
####################
Actually felt a bit sorry for Fabregas there haha
####################
Give Fernandinho red card too. Or match ban.
####################
So much respect for City for that! Fernandinho especially. Wonderful on Fabregas.
####################
FINAL: Man City 1-3 Chelsea (Cahill (ag) 45' / Costa 60', Willian 70', Hazard 90')
####################
Aguero just thought fuck it ...three game ban.

####################
Fernandinho just angry he can't be as good as Fabreags.
####################
Fabregas should've caved his head
####################
That is a potentially career ending tackle on David Luiz. Should be a 10 match ban and Fernandinho grabs Cesc by the throat. Same for him
####################
Bitch ass Fabregas
####################
That challenge from Aguero was horrific
####################
Fernanandinho what was that... 
Matured behaviour from Fabregas
####################

####################
Nasty that from Aguero. Absolutely no regard for a fellow professional. #MCICHE
####################
Proof that City are a team of losers, disgusting. Long ban for Aguero needed
####################
That was unnecessary,  Fernandinho
####################
When Aguero poped hat trick against us at the Bridge last season we didn't kill him.
####################
Fernandinho is the biggest idiot of them all
####################
Fernandinho is a cunt. In a bit you dirty cunt
####################
All turned very nasty here. Total loss of control from both sides. Aguero sent off for terrible challenge on Luiz &amp; Fernandinho off....

####################
Fabregas didn't not react to Fernandinho because he "didn't want to get involved"

The main story is that Chelsea win  their 8th match on the run and stay top
####################
Great job Fabregas.
####################
A defender frustrates a striker. He gets nothing other than a red card. Aguero lost it...
####################
Fabregas does really well not to react there. Someone grabs you like that in town, theyre dead before they have the chance to grip.
####################
It's gone mad! Aguero goes in knee high on Luiz, gets sent off, Fernandinho pushes Fabregas into the crowd, gets sent off. Mass brawl!
####################
LOOOOOOOOOL FERNANDINHO. Grabbed judas by the throat and threw him in the crowd before starting on conte. I'm goneeeeeeeeeee
####################

####################
Aguero to Kane quick before Agueros price plummets.
####################
Fernandinho and Aguero will be suspended for some time. Brazilian with hands on Fabregas' throat. #MCICHE

####################
Nah nah this is what Diego Costa does to you. Did the exact same thing to us at the Bridge last season.

@fernandinho proving he's nothing more than a grub with that. Completely useless as a player, even worse as a person.
####################
Hope Aguero has broke Luiz's spine and snapped his leg too
####################
Grim that from Aguero and Fernandinho ... not sure what those fans were trying to do either. @cesc4official did well not to react

That was a very mad moment for Aguero. What was he thinking..
####################
Fernandinho fierce or what
####################
Aguero be more stupid, but Guardiola is a close second. smh

####################
Aguero looking at a crazy ban, pushed back City's title run in the most idiotic way
####################
Very disgusting from Aguero.
####################
Fabregas showing his class
####################
De Bruyne is the only boss on there...

####################
Looool, Fabregas actually sold that Red card to Fernadinho....
####################

####################
Fernandinho moving like a wreckless malteaser
####################
Aguero did exactly the same thing Luiz did to fellaini!! He sees red!... Luiz got yellow carded! @FA remember this! Bastards
####################
We won't be seeing Aguero for a few weeks after that straight red.
####################
We've got play arsenal without Aguero and Fernandinho now
####################
That's a shocking tackle from Aguero.
Antonio Conte is some kind of manager.
Two brilliant 2nd halves in a row from Chelsea.
####################
Nah Cesc couldn't care less about that loser. https://t.co/Q6oDnt7Gcn
####################
@GoonerGordo fabregas didn't react good on him
####################
Thank God say I no put Aguero for FPL. Will have -5 or something. Hope Austin repays my faith in him

Fernandinho follows Aguero to the showers as he is sent off 1 minute after. #MCFC
####################

####################
Can't believe fernandinho thinks he is Kane putting fabregas through a table with a choke slam
####################
That challenge from Aguero deserves more than a 3-game ban #legbreaker
####################
Aguero wil miss three matches for a foolish tackle
####################
@CescPest you're forgetting you have Costa up front you spaz
####################
Fabregas has got better control than me #CFC
####################
Fabregas is a thug Mann
####################
Aguero should get a 10 match ban for that assault on David Luiz.
####################
Can only imagine that was Costa or Suarez fucking disgraceful tackle little cunt

####################
Fernandinho looks like a madman when he gets vex

####################
Horrific challenge from aguero
####################

####################
Thank God Aguero isn't my captain on fantasy league
####################
FT: Man City 1-3 Chelsea (45' Cahill o.g ; 57' Costa, 70' Willian, 90' Hazard) | Poss: 60%-40% | Shots: 12-9 | Tackles: 11-16
####################
Fabregas is getting strangled and just staring into the camera haha love it
####################
Fernandinho should be banned for what he did to cesc grabbing him round the neck
####################
Diego Costa could fuck up everyone on that pitch in a fist fight
####################
Fernandinho deserves a league winners medal just for that
####################
So boring that the fights broke off with Diego Costa on the bench.
####################
That's quality from Fabregas! Did well not to react
####################
Lovely stuff from Fernandinho
####################
Aguero tweaked
####################
That ending was fucking hilarious. Why did he push Fabregas? The guy didn't even react.
####################
Fuck off. https://t.co/FFCMCiinJU
####################
Aguero is my FPL captain and he didn't score nor assist and he got a red card. No points for him apparently
####################
How has Fabregas not reacted there ?! Pussykins.
####################
Man City Lost Everything 

Aguero,Fernandinho And Otamendi Suspended For Next Game

Oh my days aguero that is disgusting
####################
@giveawaybrazz I just bought a pixel xl, I don't need a fire hazard, thanks.
####################
And Fabregas gets away with it, the disgusting Spaniards are used to this. #PL #MCICHE
####################
@Jay__Gray who's he aguero an Charlie Austin's love child?
####################
Fabregas knew exactly what he was doing. He even looked round to see what he was going to fall on. #cheatsea
####################
Otamendi and Kolarov's defending bad, Aguero and De Bruyne's finishing worse, Anthony Taylor's incompetence the absolute worst.
####################
@Arsenes_Eyes should be, bad tackle, Fernandinho sent off as well, could miss the game too
####################
If Costa tackled like that he would be sentenced to electric chair.  #MCICHE
####################
Fernandinho went for a choke slam on Fabregas
####################
Uncalled for from both Aguero and Fernandinho. Decisions seem a bit harsh against you but don't go in unprofessionally like that #MCICHE
####################
What could fabregas said to fenandinho?
####################
Aguero should get a big ban for that foul. No attempt for the ball at all. Took Luiz out by the knee cap
####################
@eugene_101 yep, possibly no Fernandinho too
####################
I thought Costa was dirty but that ... Disgusting
####################
Crazy scenes at the Etihad!!!
Aguero with a very bad foul on David luiz, pretty late! Clearly intentional!

####################
Fernandinho to get a red Cesc must've done something stupid... dude has mad composure and such a professional! #MCICHE
####################

####################
Disgraceful challenge by Aguero and worthy red card. Fabregas should get a retrospective red for slapping Fernandinho. #cfc #mcfc
####################
Fernandinho lost his cool
####################
Aguero given straight red could  spell some disaster  for Man City next fixtures
####################
Shocking from Aguero, never a dirty player
####################
Bravo not so good...
####################
That's one of the worst challenges I've seen in a long time from Aguero. Hideous tackle.

####################
Aguero and Fernandinho are in my fantasy team ffs
####################
Why da hell was Fernandinho choking Fabregas???
####################

####################
Absolute banter from us. Played like shit and still won. Highlights should be KDB missing a sitter and Aguero getting sent off.
####################
And Aguero has just ruined just about everyone's fantasy team #MCICHE
####################
Imagine if Costa was on then hahahha
####################
Fernandinho needs to be suspended for atleast 3 games... Classless grabbing Cesc by the neck
####################
LOL KMS https://t.co/dw1bwSgy7C
####################
Wheeey so Aguero and Fernandinho red carded, referees fault... Will he banned? I doubt it very much.

####################
@jakeashton1993 Aguero's tackle was shocking
####################
Fuck Manchester &amp; Aguero for pulling that late stunt
####################
@MuzakirAhmed to clarify, wasn't a criticism as such. I love a nasty bastard. Aguero just doesn't strike you as one.
####################
But I heard you saying Bravo is a ball playing goalkeeper https://t.co/rmrW6fH40M

####################
for grabbing Fabregas, Chalobah somehow escaped for a wild barge - and in all that it finishes 3-1 to Chelsea.
####################
Awful that from Aguero
####################
Fabregas should've got sent off too.
####################
@MarkOgden_ that was poor from Fabregas, players need to be better

@TaylorTwellman moving Hazard up front instead of putting Batshuayi in worked out well.
####################
Pathetic behaviour....Aguero red long overdue!!! https://t.co/fVteDZXgHu
####################
Remove aguero he has a straight red card 3 games ban #fpl #FPL #CHEMCI
####################
Gooooood aguero
####################
Disgusting challenge from Aguero, Fernandinho will get a ban for that too. Disgraceful!!
####################
Fernandinho should've got sleeped
####################
And Fernandinho on your guy. https://t.co/WM9YMghJpV
####################
@TikiTakaToby @FA who deserves it? To be fernandinho should
####################
Transfer out Aguero immediately
####################
I notice you just hate Fabregas and Chelsea yunno https://t.co/oAPEP0rBpT
####################
Fabregas slapped Fernandinho in the face. That's why Fernandinho pushed him over the boards.
####################
@City_Watch Ref was shocking. But playing kolarov bravo and otamendi is accountable. Decent guys but just not that good at the basics
####################
This stupid cahill is going to shake people fucking cunt
####################
Abeg, Aguero messing up my Fantasy team
####################
Aguero just went full Booker T
####################
That was such a dirty challenge from Aguero, should get more than 3 for that
####################
@pcausey3 Fernandinho also repeatedly grabbing Cesc in the neck while he's clearly backing away. What the hell was that
####################
He's a sneaky little fucker that Fabregas
####################
ugly tackle from Aguero, uglier reaction from both teams. 3 point deduction for each failing to control their players #bbcfootball #MCICHE
####################
mad salty costa would've broken someone's head if he was on https://t.co/Ba90XJpNGC
####################
Lets us rest o https://t.co/4UxGOYM7st
####################
Fernandinho favela mentality kicking in
####################
Respect Fabregas. He spat out his anger. Amazing self-control. #MCICHE
####################
@ManCity Fernandinho defiantly more then a red is needed!
####################
Costa should have joined the fight
####################
I've never said it about a player before, but aguero does deserve a leg breaking tackle eventually. He does it too often to other players
####################
Wonder what the @FA will do about Aguero's challenge and Fernandinho grabbing Fabregas by the throat
####################
@Its_Sir_Dennis But I captained Costa
####################
What a fucking tackle that is from Aguero hahahaha love it.
####################
Fernandinho chokeslammed Cesc over the hoardings
####################
Fabregas set that up, started it with the cheeky little slap, deserved to end up on his ass in the crowd the horrible snidey twat
####################
Yes love a decent scrap haha Fernandinho giving it beans hahahaha
####################
Fernandinho is an ass......would he have picked on Costa like that?
####################
Costa goal

####################
What are city fans booing at? Aguero has just hacked Luiz down with a knee high challenge and fernandiniho shoved Cesc down by the throat
####################
Aguero just shegged a hella fantasy football teams there tbh
####################
Fernandinho and Aguero both shown red in the 90+6' minute. Both will be suspended for City's next match. What an embarassment
####################
Fernandinho needs to receive a VERY long ban. Absolutely no place for that fucking appalling behaviour in sport.
####################
@KishorDharma @OfficialFPL how the fuck can u have aguero costa hazard and sanchez in one team
####################
If I was Fernandinho I would've punched fabregas's cunt in
####################
Fernandinho is a twat. Fair play Fabregas.
####################
lol some City fan is going to cop a life ban for pushing Fabregas to the ground HAHAHAHA
####################
Bmt I'd spit in Aguero's face. Hope him and his family suffer
####################
Captain aguero boys
####################
Yeah red for aguero and fernandinho!
####################
@Hellqvisttri AND Fernandinho got a red card as well... didn't see the situation. #MCFCvCFC
####################
He put him in detention lool https://t.co/OqJzkcdWES
####################
Dinho killer, if that was back in Rio he would've choked Fabregas
####################
Awful and Stupid by Aguero
####################
Fernandinho aguero ban needed for Liverpool
####################
City without Aguero for probably 5 games after that challenge same for Fernandinho! Sore losers to the highest point #BBCFOOTBALL
####################
Give him two red cards.. Very stupid https://t.co/IjEC8caBTV
####################
Aguero and Fernandinho will miss our game if it's a 3 game ban!! Brilliant.
####################
Chelsea will be a rass side when dem get rid a Cahill and get a better replacement
####################
You dirty bastard Aguero!
####################
God if Costa was on the pitch would have been 3 reds
####################
Yes Aguero. About time someone nailed that cunt. The snidey shithouse
####################
Aguero sent off for a late challenge on David Luiz. #MCICHE"
####################
Why are those city fans going for Fabregas. He's just been chokeslammed over the ad boards hahaha
####################
Naa he chokeslammed him, Fernandinho is a hero
####################
Aguero's performance has been very poor; lost of confidence #MCICHE
####################
Horror tackle from Aguero. Should get more than a 3 match ban for that. Disgusting tackle, no intention of trying to win the ball
####################
Aguero feel he in the bayland ?
####################
Red card Fernandinho! Manchester City 1-3 Chelsea (City down to nine in injury-time) https://t.co/DqQ8vnx21c #mcfc #cfc
####################
At least. That was a pure throat punch. https://t.co/N4I8fpKLAt
####################
I swear I feel Aguero just hates David Luiz, THIS HAS HAPPENED BEFORE @FA
####################
@ChelseaFC nice goal by hazard, now if he could just stuck to playing football without or the bs n histrionics, he would be a decent player
####################
Football is not dead!!! Passion in the Premier League!! What a moron Fernandinho is though
####################
If the City fans were trying to go for Fabregas there, then they're full on cunts
####################
What just happened. Man City aggression let out in the last 30 seconds lose 2 players. Aguero with dumbest tackles of the year. #MCICHE
####################
Diego Costa best striker in Bpl for now #MCICHE
####################
Fantastic game of football, Costa &gt; aguero every day of the week
####################
@byreecehodgson hazard is so sick and Man City are cunts mate
####################
Aguero's done it before on Luiz https://t.co/oq0FzGWe31
####################
@GoldMindss aguero frustrated he lost it
####################
Absolutely disgusting from Aguero. City completely lost their heads there
####################
Atleast 3 match ban for Fernandinho and Aguero. With whom are they next against?
####################
Aguero's straight red for violent tackle means he misses the game against Arsenal if 3 matches suspension holds. Fernandinho also redcarded
####################
Replay showing Costa storming into the scene of the incident though HAHAHAHA
####################
Disgraceful from Aguero. Idiotic from Fernandinho. Fair play to Chalobah though because that was naughty from Aguero
####################
Fabregas take rell imps there inno I would lash him and take my card
####################
How's aguero giving me minus fpl points lool
####################
Still unacceptable from Aguero
####################
Fabregas handled that perfectly
####################
A player who shouldn't have been on the pitch https://t.co/hc0l1L43tq
####################
Poor show from City, absolute leg breaker from Aguero
####################
Fernandinho and Aguero sent off. They should be banned for several matches. Absolutely pathetic. Bad losers. #chelseafc win 3-1.
####################
Beating the shit out of Snake Fabregas

Well done Ferdaninho.
####################
What the fuck is Fernandinho doing!! What a prick.
####################
Loool no ageuro and fernandinho for 3 games, I love this ref
####################
Fabregas has to get banned as well for initial slap. Ref was awful all day. Aguero deserved his red though
####################
Fabrgas thinking he's a big man slaps Fernandinho, then get smashed into the crowd. Harsh red for him.
####################
I love Costa. I love Hazard. I love Conte. I even love David Luiz. Come on, Chelsea! #CFC
####################
city lost their heads completely there. and don't like fabregas got assaulted like that.
####################
City reduced to 9 men! Cesc clapped Fernandinho there and he pretends that he was provoked.
####################
Costa Wishes He Was Involved In That Fight
####################
Disgusting from Aguero and Fernandinho, Fabregas dealt with that so well, so much experience and class
####################
Mourinho, Wenger, Allegri..SCANSATEVE https://t.co/Sqc1PrTdrS
####################
Nahhh Aguero needs a 40 game ban that was sooooooooooooo reckless
####################
Literally the best thing that could happen to us happened today if Costa has pulled his hamstring
####################
Gudos to fabregas for holding his cool
####################
Aguero and Fernandinho will miss the matches against Leicester, Watford, and Arsenal.
####################
Gudos to fabregas for holding his cool
####################
What a wee greeting faced cunt man! Love watching them crumble https://t.co/mLgrjzw5Rm
####################
What a dirty player Fernandinho is. Fabregas literally just stood there and didn't retaliate. Surely a lengthy ban?
####################
Always hated aguero dirty cunt
####################
Need a 10 game for Fernandinho
####################
@fernandinho another despicable player. Choking @cesc4official. Should be another 5 game suspension.
####################
That was nasty from Aguero .. ban has to be coming. 3-1 to the blues !!Top of the league ! #CFC
####################
Waiting to see the media coverage on golden boy Aguero after that challenge
####################
Fernandinho &amp; Aguero miss the game against us, if we don't win...
####################
Aguero deserves an extra suspension for that
####################
Shocking tackle by Aguero! City have lost the plot!
####################
Man City no class!!! And Fabregas is amazing for not reacting
####################
Imagine if Costa would've been on the pitch at the end there...
####################
FT : Man City 1-3 Chelsea ( Cahill owngoal - Costa, Willian, Hazard)
####################
Showed faith in him for the big game and picked Aguero as my captain and then he does that to me the Argie fuck, the Falklands are ours
####################
It's fair to say Chelsea should be pleased Costa was off when that kicked off
####################
When you use your hand to put ata gigun inside a fresh open wound https://t.co/cZX2I20HhA

####################
Fabregas deserved that. But fuck me what an ending! #cityvcfc
####################
Shitty without Aguero, Fernandinho and Otamendi for Leicester.
####################
@pernollie Agree. It is the only target Aguero didn't miss today.
####################
Horrible from Aguero that
####################
Regretting replacing Hazard with Aguero as captain of my @OfficialFPL team this week... #MCICHE #minuspoints
####################
Some pwopah Sunday League defending followed by a Sunday League tackle from Aguero and a bit of handbags. Settle it in the car park, lads
####################
Fabregas is such a piece of shit..... how can he live with himself is beyond me.....
#MCICHE
####################
Fernandinho also out for the Leicester, Watford and Arsenal game.
####################
That was a fucking shocker from Aguero. Embarrassing.
####################
Fabregas slapping Fernandinho will we see action taken against him? #MCFCvCFC
####################
Fabregas keeping his cool brilliantly. What a pro.
####################
@JohnBrewinESPN Fabregas slapped Fernandinho then pushed himself over the barrier. Moron.
####################
Fernandinho what a hero. Chelsea wankers
####################
Fernamdinho sullies a strong match by falling for the Fabregas goad. Dummy.
####################
@aguerosergiokun you shit https://t.co/qxUOh2lKRg
####################
Only if de bruyne didn't miss that
####################
Fernandinho getting banned for five games, tough times coming for pep.
####################
Aguero can't handle Luiz. I've never seen someone be someone else's bitch for so long.
####################
I would've punched Fernandinho in the face, if I was Fabregas tbvh. Cunt of the highest order.
####################
Fabregas slapped him then walked backwards over the sign, nothing doing there
####################
When you captain Aguero rather than Costa.. #FPL https://t.co/bnK2dxBtNP
####################
Fabregas done well not to react #MCICHE
####################
Imagine if Costa was on the pitch, these city players wouldn't even try it
####################
Manchester City players are frustrated, fernandinho deserves more than 3 match ban after his red card #ManCityvsChelsea #cityvcfc
####################
Got to admire Fabregas' temperament there
####################
That was disgusting from Aguero #MCICHE
####################
Fernandinho and Aguero should get lengthy bans for that... Awful challenge and reaction
####################
Fernandinho will have a multiple match ban for that as well
####################
Respect for Fabregas city players being cunts under a cunt manager named Pep #CHEMCI
####################
Great end to the game for Manchester City. Disgusting tackle sees Aguero sent off and Fernandinho is off too for a head butt. Crazy scenes.
####################
Aguero is a fucking nugget aswell

#DavidLuiz earlier in the match taking care of #Aguero when he got a knock and now  Aguero does this?! #Scum #MCFCHE
####################
Fabregas got what he deserved win that gay little slap
####################
Does this mean aguero and fernadinho miss the Arsenal game??
####################
If there was ever a violent conduct charge, it belongs to Sergio Aguero
####################
Exact same as what Fernandinho did
####################
No one compare aguero and costa again to me I don't wanna hear that bull shit aguero is trash

Aguero &amp; Fernandinho sending off sum up a truly bad day for us in the end. #MCFC
####################
He's a proper scumbag aguero needs ending
####################
@paddypower hate chelsea but city r a disgrace aguero also costing me valuable fantasy point
####################
Fabregas is a melt lettin Fernandinho push him about like that
####################
Hope lots of people have Aguero as fantasy football captain
####################
Tasty tackle that from Aguero! #bosh
####################
Aguero was on top speed and wanted to cross the ball
It's worth a card but not red
####################
@danlevene fabregas did really well not to rise to that!
####################
Concentre toi way bro ! https://t.co/iHkIoagX6E

Full Time - PREM Manchester City 1 Chelsea 3. Costa, Willian &amp; Hazard on target for Chelsea, Cahill Own Goal for 9 man City. #MCICHE
####################
And fuck why is Fernandinho chocking Fabregas? So aggressive for no reason. Cesc doesn't even react.
####################
that costa performance will go down in history ffs
####################
Thank you, Fabregas.

Haha Fabregas chickened out
####################
Fernandinho and Aguero red. 
3 points at Eitihad.
Top of the league.
Costa and Hazard goals.
Conte masterclass. https://t.co/oaOkUSIU6e
####################
Love Neville on a commentary. Chalobah should push aguero over. They players and managers should show passion. Bang on.
####################
Why am I not surprised Aguero made that foul, that is twice on David-Luis!!!!!
####################
Told ya https://t.co/YzNqAUNeD9
####################
Hope the FA consistent with the bans. Pep sarcastically applauding the ref is worse than a water bottle kick no? Fernandinho ban incoming
####################
Conte starting fabregas in suck a crucial match shows he knows his stuff
####################
I'll say one thing City are lucky costa wasn't in the pitch. He would have smashed
####################
time to up the Hazard propaganda
####################
City are finished red card or aguero and fernandinho loool
####################
That was a leg breaker challenge from Aguero..Absolutely ridiculous
####################
6 matches for Aguero....?
####################
Fabregas played that smart. Looks like a slag but he did well
####################
Neville again proving why he is the master of analysis. Also how did Fabregas not also see red? #scuffle
####################
I remember when Aguero elbowed Reid and the media was trying to say Aguero 'is not that type of player'. Clear evidence he's a dirty prick
####################
timnas win chelsea win diego hazard goal aguero red card. what a night kkk
####################
No aguero or Fernandinho against Watford. Nice.
####################
Iheanacho displaying his stupidity.. That was a nasty foul by aguero for Christ sake...chaloba looks much bigger than him btw.. #MCICHE
####################
City have done a Tottenham, something about this Chelsea team winds other teams up, absolute stupidity from Aguero
####################
Nearly broke luiz's leg and grabbing fabregas by the neck and pushing him over the advertising boards who the fuck are you
####################
In fairness to fernandinho tho and all the brazilian players their emotions will be all over the place after the crash
####################
Hope Aguero is banned for 10+ games.
####################
True but Chalobah and Fabregas deserve bans too https://t.co/5g7cdp4Z5w
####################
Loooool Fabregas you're a big man uno, letting a guy treat you like a bitch
####################
Chelsea winners all round - 3-1 away to Man City who had Aguero and Fernandinho sent off in stoppage time

Absolutely disgraceful from the city players at the end, terrible challenge from aguero and other city players for reacting #MCICHE
####################
Shoulda beat Fabregas ass. That was a red  I was taking
####################
Aguero you wasteman. Messing up my fantasy points
####################
I was really upset about Aguero &amp; then realised I dropped him from my fantasy team &amp; replaced him with Costa

Who's the best keeper RT  BravoLike Heart #MCICHE

Shocking from aguero

Lucky Costa wasn't on , he would of been booked

Aguero has the highest being a scumbag:portrayed as a scumbag ratio in the league

Not the first time Kunt Aguero has done Luiz, by the way
####################
Disgraceful from all the City players here! Fernandinho grabbing Fabregas by the throat. Absolutely appalling. #mcfc
####################
Aguero and Fernandinho have just ruined a good game there
####################
@RichArrowsmith oh, so Kun for two footer by the pic. What did fernandinho do?
####################
Heads well and truly lost by #MCFC Awful challenge by Aguero, stupid from Fernandinho!Disgraceful scenes at the end...entertaining mind you!
####################
Aguero needs a 6 match ban, fucking horrific tackle.
####################
Happy with Aguero's card; at least Iheanacho can get a run of 3-4 games. He needs to dip city before they make him Mikel
####################
Fernandinho has got to get a 4+ ban
####################
2 straight reds for Aguero and Fernandinho LIT!
####################
I've defended the Bravo decision for footballing reasons but I at least expect him to be able to make himself big for 1v1s. Disgrace. #MCFC
####################
Joe Hart comes on for Bravo.
####################
The best thing is no Aguero/Fernandinho when we play City! #COYG
####################
@RECKLESSDJ_ fabregas gave him a little slap I think!
####################
Fernandinho and aguero are both fucking pussies i would have fucked fernandinho up if he did that to me
####################
Fernandinho should be fined. Hard. That was nonsense.
####################
Should be a minimum 3 match ban for Aguero and Fernandinho.
####################
- point aguero ni haish
####################
@biltonsteve fair play to fabregas not reacting
####################
No Fernandinho you can't do that
####################
what a bad ending to the game! didn't except this kind of discipline from Guardiola's team. aguero and fernandinho sent of. POOR
####################
@B_ELRUFAI if you take Diego Costa and Eden Hazard out who have Chelsea got
####################
Seriously Aguero should be banned for AT LEAST 5 games, worst challenge I've seen in ages #MCFC #MCICHE
####################
@fernandinho what a c*** you are
####################
I dunno how fabregas kept composure like that
####################
Fam Costa won this for Chelsea. 
Solid player!
####################
Fabregas ass fell out mate
####################
Just witnessed Fernandinho trying to chokeslam Fabregas #MCICHE
####################
Fernandinho is such a little bitch &amp; so is aguero
####################
Aguero forever bottling
####################
Aguero you spiteful nasty cunt!
####################
@TonyBarrett Mourinho was too big of an ego and switched hazard/Costa off. When they are on form, best pair in prem by far!
####################
Aguero with the Sunday League 'that guy has yellow boots' challenge.
####################
A time of remembrance https://t.co/8QFmBiWgHK
####################
Clearly...Aguero was frustrated
####################
They waited for Costa to get off so they could bring out the handbags.. City clowns...
####################
Fuck you #Fernandinho... fuck you fucker.... black ass nigga
####################
@mpudasainee I hate Aguero ;)
####################
What a piece of shit Fernandinho.
####################
That's was brilliant. The league needs more of that. Aguero with the tackle of the season. Brilliant from both players. #CFC #MCFC
####################
Conte masterclass, done them in their own backyard, inside all their heads, fuck off Aguero, fuck off Fernandinho, fuck off Guardiola #fraud
####################
For the first time in time Costa was not that center of a fight.
####################
If Suarez or Costa did that they'd wanna lynch em, stupid count
####################
Aguero sent off? Finally rewarded for not having him in my fantasy team!
####################
Fabregas is a wind up merchant. Gave Fernandinho a little tap round the cheek &amp; let it go the little shit
####################
Not surprised Aguero lost his head.After all his manager ia Guardiola.Sore losers indeed.
####################
Aguero with one of the best tackles I've ever seen. Fuckin love that
####################
Should be a red card for Aguero...disgusting, dangerous and needless challenge...knee high! And is...Fernandinho too.
####################
Great stuff, Hazard and Alonso!
####################
We lost our heads it a joke we shouldn't be doing that. Aguero tackle was awful and definitely a red. #MCFC
####################
Hope Costa gets involved at drops John Stones. Fucking Barnsley count
####################
Fuck this ref fabregas slapped fernandinho
####################
Imagine Costa was still on when that all kicked off.
####################
Fabregas was moving shookkkk
####################
Aguero and Fernandinho both out of the game vs Arsenal, I'll take that.
####################
3 game ban for Aguero, he'll miss our game. Also 3 games for Fernandinho but I reckon that could be extended.
####################
Fernandinho as well, hands around Fabregas' neck and pushed him
####################
2 red cards and one wasn't Costa? Wow!
####################
What a dirty bastard.

#Aguero
####################
@nr147 brutal challenge there! Fernandinho lost the plot there entirely too
####################
Word RT @TheChelseaBlog: Credit to Diego Costa, couple of reds in that brawl and he wasn't one of them
####################
Holy shit duch a dirty red card to aguero. Wow that was almost a line brawl at the end! What a match!!
####################
Aguero, my FPL captain..

You know the rest.
####################
Man city should've gone 2-0 up so it wouldn't have ended 3-1 and Luiz should've gone off in the first half so Aguero wouldn't have gone
####################
Gonna have to sell my Xbox to get the SIF/POTM Costa
####################
So glad they lost their cool, Fernandinho too? https://t.co/BKjCFvkooi
####################
Had Aguero as my FPL captain and Hazard as vice. Good choice ;_;
####################
Fernandinho what a lad
####################
Shocking tackle from Aguero there. If you can even call it a tackle. What a twat.
####################
@MarkOgden_ aguero should get a ten game ban for that tackle
####################
Aguero sucks . That was a disgusting challenge . City have lost their heads. Conte has completely out managed Guardiola here!
####################
Beautiful https://t.co/aKmeNQd3zy

That was a shocking tackle from Aguero &amp; Fernandinho should be ashamed hope he gets the book thrown at him no need for what he did #MCICHE
####################
@Paapaliii you want more? https://t.co/miS1nPInf3
####################
@arseblog Fabregas slaps Fernadinho and then wants nothing of it when confronted
####################
Next time we play City, David Luiz should deliberately try and snap Aguero in half. I've had enough of this cunt.
####################
Hart is fuckin better than bravo.
####################
So lemme check how many points Hazard and Costa gave me.... #FPL
####################
Did no one else see fabregas slap fernandino?
####################
Absolute shocker that from Aguero
####################
A Man City meltdown. Poor from Aguero.
####################
Bout time Aguero got sent off for a challenge on David Luiz.
####################
Let's hope Costa, Pedro and Luiz aren't to baldy injured
####################
Didn't think Aguero could go further up in my estimations but he just has, what a challeng
####################
MERRY CHRISTMAS EVERYONE. https://t.co/WB5guhNCJX

####################
City have lost it. Absolutely disgusting challenge from Aguero
####################
@Mike87_MUFC Aguero certainly did
####################
Hats off Fabregas. No reacting whatsoever!

Fabregas deserves a thorough a** whooping!!!

I hope Aguero broke Luiz's leg
####################
Hahaha fuck off city socking tackle from aguero #seeya

####################
Good to see Fabregas not reacting
####################
Wow what scenes at city. Aguero and Fernandinho sent off in the dying moments. Still a massive 3 points! 3-1 Chelsea. COYB
####################
If Aguero went in with a slight degree more force, that could've snapped Luiz's leg.

Hit all the right places on the shin imo #MCICHE
####################
Fernandinho so stupid
####################
Lol. Fabregas was the first one to provoke Fernandinho by slapping him.

Aguero is moving mad, I've seen Conor McGregor do less than that
####################
Lol aguero wanted to injure luiz no doubt

Fabregas doing a Rivaldo of 2002, Lol. Guardiola go show us him coaching certificate oh! I sure say him Cgpa no reach 2.0, I fit bet.

Awful challenge by Aguero, man city players showing how to lose without dignity! Poor end to the game! #CFC
####################
Stinker that from both Aguero and Fernandinho
####################
"@Badass_pmf: U see why I don't like fernandinho??..he is an asshole" he is just a bully...thats all
####################
Hi @FA I saw De Bruyne using knuckle dusters there. Please suspend him.
####################
Aguero and Fernandinho went Diego Costa there.
####################
Fernandinho also received straight red. Full time: #MCFC 1-3 #cfc (Costa, Willian, Hazard) #PremierLeague
####################
Yo nah if that was costa one jab hook would of been delivered
####################
Fabregas did well not to react to that. What a tool. Thank god Costa wasn't on the pitch #MNCCHE
####################
Imagine having Aguero as your FPL captain
####################
Hope Fernandinho gets a huge ban. What a twat he is.
####################
@Abimbola_A lol, costa is who you call a striker mate
####################
LOL, God save Chelsea that Costa wasn't on the pitch. He'd have been interested and possibly get himself sent off too
####################
Fabregas weren't on
####################
Fabregas getting bullied lmao
####################
Is that Aguero &amp; Fernandinho out of Arsenal game?
####################
Fernandinho is such a cunt
So is aguero
####################
This game turned ugly real fast. Amazingly enough Diego Costa wasn't involved. #MCICHE
####################
took aguero out for costa too. I'm top of the work one. Out of 200 people.
####################
Outrageous tackle from Aguero, ill discipline from Fernandinho and co... 3 game bans for both, happy days #LFC
####################
Aguero and Fernandinho both out of the Arsenal game???
####################
Fair play to fabregas there well played!!
####################
Amazing fishing rod work from Cesc, baited Fernandinho a treat
####################
City embarrassing. Look at Fabregas just remain his cool.
####################
Silly from aguero and Fernandinho, gonna miss them for however long they're banned for
####################
Fernandinho the hooligan #MCICHE
####################
@bibi89bibi fernandinho reacted like he is playing street football. not professional at all.
####################
i learnt from cesc fabregas and yaya toure today, his conduct was professional #mciche
####################
Laughable end from Man City! What a win from the blues, Hazard is the best player in the world.

####################
Costa would have ruined some city players there
####################
lol.. Aguero and Fernandinho sent off. won't be available for next 3 matches! Yay! Cesc should've been sent off too
####################
Hopefully someone repays Aguero the favour with a challenge like that, his career would be done
####################
5 match ban bmt that was disgusting https://t.co/0h5whoXdGi
####################
@anaIdirgeprat fabregas started it with Fernandinho. He should be off as well as Chaloba
####################
Well, that was more Coon Aguero, or Goon Aguero, than that was Kun Aguero #MCICHE
####################
Fernandinho is a disgrace, I hate Fabregas but he did nothing writ there. Pre-season prediction that Chelsea will win the league looks good
####################
Fucking Aguero just messed up my damn EPL fantasy weekend smh
####################
Cesc with no reaction to Fernandinho grabbing his throat. He looked down and backed off. Pure class! Manchester City, woeful.

SENT OFF! Sergio Aguero shown red for a disgusting tackle on David Luiz and Fernandinho sent off for grabbing Fabregas. #MCICHE
####################
De Bruyne is just a big fool
####################
Officially seen the light, Costa &gt; Aguero
####################
@lewtheycollide Fernandinho is a bit of a crybaby huh? :-/
####################
If Suarez/Costa had ever grabbed anyone by the throat twice and then pushed them over an advertisement board everyone would be going mad
####################
Crazy tackle from Aguero and Cesc did well not to react to all that nonsense from Fernandinho
####################
I know right https://t.co/uY826GtxKi
####################
That's got to be at least a 6 match ban for Aguero. That was assault, not a tackle.
####################
@MKRAMERSH Costa might be injured, got subbed off
####################
Chaos at the end of an enthralling match. #Aguero, #Fernandino sent off at the end for #City. Final score: 3-1 to #Chelsea. #MCICHE
####################
Was just about to say Fabregas has been good but scratch that, he's a fucking legend.
####################
Aguero and Fernandihno lost their heads @Bridget_Otoo @KojoNketsia
####################
Fernandinho should get a red a well. 

Dickhead attitude
####################
Someone should have banged Fernandinho
####################
Why you pick costa over aguero in fantasy lol
####################
Fabregas just absolutely shut himself from Fernandinho hahaha dropped with a throat push
####################
Fabregas riled him up  https://t.co/Ciz0Y3rhBC
####################
Only surprising player today is Aguero. 

Am not just understanding him today
####################
Retweeted Chelsea Transfers (@CFCTransfers):

Fernandinho sent off too. Disgusting.
####################
Aguero and Fernandinho ruining the game there right at the end, and letting their team mates down most importantly #MCICHE
####################
And Fernandinho too
####################
Aguero wants to take the rest of the year off. Clearly doesn't want to play on Boxing Day.
####################
@OfficialFPL When you take Costa out of your team and leave Aguero in you know your #FantasyFootball curse is strong.
####################
Its all kicked off at city! Aguero and fernandinho sent off! #MCICHE
####################
LMFAO AGUERO IS PETTY https://t.co/jid3mBcrUA
####################
People abusing Costa for discipline. Aguero has had two bans now. Pure scum the cunt. Must go play for Barca.
####################
@FA Fabregas slaps a player and gets away with it. I won't what would happen if it was @ManUtd player
####################
After looking for trouble https://t.co/ss94cbIOGa
####################
It's about fucking time Aguero got a red for one of those challenges. The wanker, big up @chalobah for stepping up too
####################
Nice work aguero.
####################
He could have done what he did to costa na, dead player(Fernandinho)
####################
What a prick Aguero is
####################
Aguero is a wonderful player but he can be a real dirty horrible little cunt.
####################
Not the 1st time Aguero has gone in on Luiz like that
####################
Disgraceful from aguero. Peps city are similar to Barca in that they are shit houses,  In footballing terms nowhere near #cityvcfc
####################
Fernandinho is also sent off. #MCICHE
####################
LMAO Fabregas helped Fer get sent off. Dude let him push him very well...
####################
Lmao Fabregas you sneaky bastard
####################
Fernandinho made fabregas look like a little bitch
####################
Well City ruin a great game because they can't lose with dignity. That challenge from Aguero was disgusting. Great result for us #MCICHE
####################
Aguero has been and always will be a nasty little Prat to put it as politely as I can #MCICHE @ChelseaFC
####################
He's on cheap drugs https://t.co/VnUekFO1u4

Fernandinho follows Aguero to the showers as he is sent off 1 minute after. #MCFC #sportstar
####################
"@AA__official: I have costa, hazard and Marcos Alonso in my FPL....bow down bitchessss" 21 points in d bag no bonus points kuma
####################
Hilarious city spent the game trying to wind Costa up then fell for it themselves. 2 off, Fernandinho couldn't sort my mum out the clown
####################
Thanks Aguero for ruining #FPL
####################
I wonder what Cesc said to Fernandinho?
####################
Dont think #Aguero likes Luiz part two https://t.co/BruGoO2KwC
####################
@ChuBoi fernandinho choked him tho
####################
Fernandinho should be banned for a while for that. Horrible
####################
Seeing Fabregas being pushed over really does warm the cockles of Arsenal fans.
####################
Disgusting behaviour from fernandinho, no time for that at all, he deserves a 10 match ban
####################
Class game. Had everything. Total shithousery by Aguero.
####################
City should be ashamed of themselves . Disgusting from Fernandinho also
####################
Fabregas didnt even think about hitting back. Love the discipline
####################
Disgusting behaviour by @ManCity they are meant to be role models. Aguero tackle was a disgrace could have caused serious injury
####################
If my captain in fantasy (Aguero) has negative points, do I get double the negative points?
####################
Great https://t.co/e86pZycHpg
####################
huge respect .. i would've stole Fernandinho if i were Fabregas https://t.co/2H1rCfOWcP
####################
Watch PL rescind both red cards and allow Aguero and Fernandinho to play against Arsenal
####################
@GoziemO broooo how far Aguero now is he frustrated or..?
####################
@nathss21 listen, if I could, I'd pay Fernandinho's fine
####################
Biased commentators , Fabregas brushed Fernandinho on the face before Fernandinho chocked him.  #MCICHE
####################
CLASSIC Aguero.. That's his character shining thru again.

Him &amp; Fernandinho deserve multi gm suspensions. 
#bye #DontCheeseMe #CFC #ManCity
####################
My condolences to all Aguero owners...#FPL
####################
Shitty team this #ManCity, but #Fabregas deserved a red card as well! FU #Aguero, sour loser like some guy we all know!

Horrible from Fernandinho that. Fabregas not responding at all and he carries on attacking him.
####################
E good say I captain Hazard ahead of Aguero
####################
Pep was flavour of the month, it's Conte's time now. Filthy challenge by Aguero, ends in mayhem...Huge win for Chelsea #MCICHE
####################
For some weird reason,  a commotion without Costa .

You have to give it to Conte. He calmed him
####################
@Megson84 how cool was cesc when Fernandinho had his hand round his throat?
####################
That was a nasty foul by Aguero, taking out his frustrations with the game by trying to break Luiz' leg.
####################
Aguero and Fernandinho are an utter disgrace. Chalobah and and Fabregas deserve so much credit for that. #MCFCvCFC
####################
What a Prick, fabregas did fuck all there aswell
####################
@Cloutinho Good start with Chelsea 13/5 and Hazard 5/2, although he scuppered the 12/1 correct score!
####################
Aguero is such a flaming shit bitch
####################
They say stuff about Costa but he's surpassed Aguero mentality wise and debatably ability wise too.
####################
Aguero and Fernandinho missing our game.
Nice.
####################
Would've been funnier if Costa got involved in the middle
####################
Like e man a him bitch https://t.co/Et12nHDVx6
####################
oh shit lupa letak aguero sub dekat fpl. who cares. top of the league. gg ez noob city
####################
Biggest suprirse of all is that Costa has been on 4 yelloe cards for weeks now. What a man.
####################
Aguero is a proper horrible bastard as well, protected by refs / the FA for too long because he's been city's poster boy
####################
I'm not surprised by Aguero's challenge
####################
FT Man City 1-3 CHELSEA Goal : Cahill (og) Costa, Willian &amp; Hazard.
####################
Aguero and Fernandinho will be gone for a long time. The 3 points not the only thing City lost tonight
####################
If Dinho and Aguero don't get 5+ game bans this sport is finished
####################
I put Aguero into my Fantasy Team this morning so i will take full credit for this result
####################
Right eh. https://t.co/GQ7vYpWi6B

@City_Watch Aguero needs to cop onto himself. That was a joke

@ManCity great denfending by Fernandinho

####################
See how stupid Sergio Aguero  is...
####################
Game of the fucking season. Fernandinho has been rubbish, KDB was quiet, Aguero deserves no respect.
####################
Hallo #Shearer ...How is the performance of your choice of the only top player in the league?
#MatchDay #MCICHE #Aguero
####################
fernandinho is about it,cesc was smart not to try nuttin
####################
The real mystery is how Costa didn't get a card in this game
####################
Wow. Aguero's darkest day in his  career. Lost the title of best striker in the league to Costa and got rustled by Luiz. What a virgin.
####################
Terrible challenge by aguero deserved to go!
####################
Aguero and Fernadinho both get a red card while the match was basically over lmao how stupid can you be
####################
That is absolutely disgraceful from Aguero. Book should be thrown at him. That is shocking. City imploding.
####################
Horrific tackle from Aguero. Disgusting behavior from Fernandinho - Kudos to Fabregas for not reacting. #ManCityvsChelsea
####################
@Nigeriainfofm thank God costa is not in d match any more
####################
The player who went up to Fabregas and pushed him *by the throat* whilst he was backing away? Should never play football again.
####################

And we'll still lose. Book it. https://t.co/9DLhdfe3cK
####################
That was a vicious tackle from Aguero... it's exactly like the video they show you in Ref class of what a "straight red card" looks like..
####################
Great goals from Hazard, Willian, Costa and Cahill!.
####################
Filthy tackle from Aguero deserved sending off , City lost the plot #citychelsea
####################
Fabregas resurrection today
####################
@LPHManc this is the only passion the fat fuck aguero has, no passion to score during the game

Fabregas smart, but disappointing from city players
####################
@ManCity sign cahill
####################
Funny seeing Fabregas shit his pants tho
####################
#Aguero AND #Fernandinho are both suspended  against @Arsenal now HAHAHAHA
####################
Aguero is a cunt! Not the first time he has tried to break David luiz's leg
####################
I'm just happy for those that captained Aguero
####################
Cahill smile now cos your days are numbered
####################
If #luiz did that to #aguero people would be calling for his head. Sickening challenge that rightfully angered team mates. #MCICHE #Chelsea
####################
Life threatening tackle from Kun Aguero... Very bad
#MCICHE #EPL
####################
Captain Aguero for the first time in weeks and he sent off, brilliant
####################
fernandinho will have a very bad punishment
####################
Great football match that. Classic Chelsea ! 3 match ban for aguaro, city are fucked. The cuteness of fabregas letting Fernandinho choke him
####################
Typical #mcfc disgusting from aguero and Fernandinho. Lose with dignity you bunch of horrible cunts #MCICHE
####################
Aguero banned for a month, disgraceful, he could end luiz career because he is pussy and lost a ball for a moment? Fking disgusting scum
####################
Aguero: frustrated crybaby #MCICHE #KTBFFH
####################
That's Sergio and Fernandinho out of the game with us
####################
Gary Neville has just stated on live tv that he doesn't care about the rules and Chalobah was right to push Aguero to the ground, nob head
####################
Aguero deserves all he gets with that red card. Disgusting. Been a long time coming
####################
So stupid by Dinho and Aguero. Just why?!
####################

####################
If football doesn't work, Aguero has a career in wrestling. That dropkick madt die!
####################
Fabregas just knows he's playing Fernandinho for a red card. Idiotic from Fernandinho tbh.
####################
It's getting rowdy!! Aguero sent off, absolute filthy challenge. Deserved the sending off !! Fernandinho is an equally dirty bastard #MCICHE
####################
Fernandinho going to Febregas' neck is classless. He gets a red too. Fabregas did well not to respond. Ugly finish. #Chelsea win 3-1.
####################
Thank fuck I changed my captain and not have aguero C! He will get 4 match bin imo tho...
####################
Wouldn't be surprised if Fernandinho and Aguero both get extended bans, disgusting that
####################
Mostly, but Guardiola should be right behind him in line for the canes https://t.co/BL960mov9q

Aguero and Fernandinho out against us, perfect

Surprisingly civil reaction from Fabregas there tbf, not many players would have done what he did.
####################
.@fernandinho &lt;sarcasm&gt; my, you are so fearsome and impressive &lt;/sarcasm&gt; enjoy sitting on your bum for the next three games+

Fair play to Fabregas for handling that situation like the professional he is!

@JoeCollings123 TAKE THE BLOODY CHANCE! No Fernandinho too
####################
Tbd twatting fabregas would have been totally worth it

Fucking idiot aguero go suck u mada ute!!!!

Unprofessional behavior from Aguero and Fernandinho

How fabregas did not retaliate is beyond me.

Fabregas slapped him https://t.co/a016g8HhlQ
####################
@JonnyBoyQPR Oh I dunno, throwing Fabregas into the crowd was funny but I see your point.
####################
Aguero is wicked player that was how he kicked same David Luiz 2012...

Awful from Aguero. Sly from Fabregas, lil slap on Fernandinho and then falling over the boards. Rubbish end to what was a good game. Shame.

Fernandinho should kuku go and kill him
####################
LOL FERNANDINHO SIGN HIM @Everton
####################
Aguero quite clearly went in to deliberately hurt Luiz. Their reaction is quite frankly appalling.
####################
Aguerro and fabregas should be ashamed of themselves for that
####################
What's wrong with Bravo..
####################
Aguergo is a cunt that is horrific costa would get the jail for a challenge like that .bad loosers, unbelievable second half from Chelsea
####################
AUGERO AND FERNANDINHO TO MISS ARSENAL?
####################
@ManCity your side has some of the lowest class of players on your side. Aguero should be sat for the rest of the year. CHELSEA CHELSEA
####################
Aguero did something similar to Luiz some time back. Mother fucker. Got away scot free that time.
####################
I can't help but feel that Fabregas deserved that. Should have seen red too.
####################
@Maggot_4_Life fabregas did nothing
####################
Huge fan of Fabregas just play
####################
Fernandinho thought its WWE RAW
####################
Fabregas slap on Fernandinho when he was trying to diffuse the situation?!?!? Unnoticed. Unmentioned. Shock.
####################
Thank god that cunt aguero got sent off, despise him
####################
That is the most ridiculous match I've ever seen. And now Aguero and Fernandinho are banned for 3 games. Brilliant
####################
@ManCity Just sell Aguero and sign Lewandowski or Aubameyang
####################
Aguero wasting 3 clear chances then getting a Red card. Pathetic, out of my #FPL
####################
Aguero shattered my team, omo ale
####################
AGUERO WAS JUST BREATHING
####################
Aguero's tackle absolutely horrific, deserves much more than a 3 match ban
####################
@DeadlyMartial I don't blame Fernandinho for doing what he did fabregas pushed him in the face
####################
This ref has had an atrocious game. Poor decisions all around. Aguero and Fernandinho deserve to go off, but not even 1 Chelsea player?
####################
Love how Cahill kept his composure

It will take Aguero another five years to reach Lord Sanogo's level. Ghost striker

Well done to Fabregas for not reacting

Wtf was Aguero doing. Awful challenge

Fabregas clearly hit Fernandinho first...having said that, both red cards are hard to argue

Fernandinho did fuck up Fabregas tho so maybe we should allow him
####################
Aguero and Fernandinho miss the game against us then. Cheers.
####################
Meltdown from the city players - Aguero's tackle was horrific &amp; Fernandinho completely lost control. Poor refereeing but Chelsea deserved it

Hello @ManCity give Serge and Fernandinho pay rises. Now THAT's the passion I want to see.

Aguero should be banned for a long time
####################
Fabregas should've been off for slapping
####################
Aguero set to miss Arsenal game!

Amazing Second Half! Great Goals By Costa, Willian And Hazard

https://t.co/57wQpwLohj
####################
Aguero lined up Luiz and went knee high and then tried again. A leg breaker.
####################
Aguero with a total head loss looool
####################
Kante is the best CDM in the world, don't care.
####################
This is not Aguero's first time. Fucking cunt. https://t.co/1tERuHMCQi
####################
Fernandinho. What the fuck are you doing? So unprofessional
####################
Wtf Aguero. That's so bad
####################
Thanks for nothing Aguero #fpl
####################
Fernandinho the travesty
####################
Luiz is a right cunt he always seems to get away with it. Aguero is no saint either that was a filthy challenge.
####################
@oddschecker Can't afford Aguero (most weeks he gets good points though) hard to accomodate him other players need to be crap to have him.
####################
What a win!!! Fabregas Costa everyone awesome
####################
Aguero is a little bitch too, enjoy your time off for Christmas muggins.
####################
@country_brute especially the taunting by Fernandinho on Cesc. Three match ban, @FA surely?
####################
Fernandinho what a joke
####################
LOL Fernandinho lost his head big time !
####################
Fabregas going to get retrospective 3 match ban for the face slap since the referee completely missed it #MCICHE
####################
One of the worst challenges I've seen from Aguero in a long long time.
####################
Pipe player https://t.co/HubEGqZfpz
####################
"Not Kun, he's civilised unlike that animal Costa" https://t.co/MsSNXFOZC8
####################
We might be shit but our players will never react like that. Utterly embarrassing from Aguero and City, bitter cunts.
####################
Fabregas just let off for slapping Fernandinho then? Shocker...
####################
Credit to Fabregas. Kept his calm and got Fernandinho rightfully sent off.
Pep Guardiola has arrived to the PL with his beautiful football.
####################
Aguero fucking piece of shit, wasted chances and a red. My fpl captain
####################
Bravo is a world class keeper ? Is he really ?
####################
Fernandinho and Aguero should be suspended for the rest of the damn season. Pathetic fucking #ManchesterCity thugs. #Chelsea top bitches!!
####################
@fernandinho your a disgusting player. Be upset bet putting your hands on someones throat? Hope you get banned and fined from tye FA. Dirty
####################
@fernandinho you dirty scummy cunt
####################
That tackle from Aguero, absolutely disgusting
####################
Class from fabregas then
####################
the funny thing is Fernan can pipe up to Cesc bcus he knows he won't react but why didn't he do the same to Costa or Chalobah? lun matey
####################
Aguero should get a huge ban for that as well disgusting tackle could of seriously hurt Luiz with that
####################
From bad to worse for #MCFC. Not just a defeat but Aguero and Fernandinho both red carded and seemingly out for the next 3 league games
####################
@samuelluckhurst Aguero and Fernandinho should both get bans
####################
Fernandinho should be getting a 5 match ban for that minimum. great composure by fabregas
####################
Lol if De Bruyne puts away that chance the game would've been so different.
####################
@fernandinho Was a mess today. What a shame for the soccer world and for Brazil.
####################
Ooooh, does that mean Aguero is suspended for our game up there? How no Chelsea player got a red card in that game is a mystery...
####################
if that was in bim you feel fernandinho coulda get way with that, football done fam
####################
Top of the fuckin table https://t.co/tKfDje5Dic
####################
Felt sorry for Fabregas then #CFC
####################
Luiz especially. Dunno how that guy escapes https://t.co/LqLPtsokxa
####################
Fabregas absolutely soiled himself thete, it's one thing picking on someone, but you have to accept someone will call you on it!

#MCICHE
####################
@AFCMemz should be 5 game ban minimum. Either way he misses arsenal game and do does fernandinho
####################
Cesc is a better man than me, Fernandinho would be on the ground.
####################
Great performance 8 in a row im so happy 
The ending was poor no need for that from aguero showing his real colours
####################
Aguero and Fernandinho to miss the match against us due to their red cards..
####################
LOL City counts. Don't @ fabregas Fernandinho you pathetic excuse for a footballer. Hahahah wankers. Brilliant bit of stoppage time banter
####################
Chelsea won't win any league with Gary Cahill and Alonso in defence they're appalling
####################
Ha ha ha #mancity. Amazing restraint from #Fabregas . Go Chelsea.
####################
Imagine costa doing that. Fuck me
####################
Cesc actually played good. But i dont expect you to credit him for that ofcourse https://t.co/mYISvh0TIc
####################
Lol Aguero straight red and no goals. Costa top goalscorer, scored the winner and on 4 yellows, cool and calm. Pure myth that Costa is wild
####################
Aguero is such a dirty prick
####################
Fernandinho took fabregas for his son
####################
@fernandinho you're a fucking prick, fuck off!!
####################
Aguero is a wonderful player, but that was grim!
####################
Genuinely believe there was intent from Aguero to break his leg with that tackle. Absolutely disgusting challenge
####################
Is he feeling OK? https://t.co/AWFaNlDGLA
####################
Fernandinho should be banned from football
####################
Diego costa to stick the hade in that fud fernandinho
####################
Fernandinho made Cesc look like a fucking Nancy boy. So damn embarrassing lmao.
####################
What an ugly end to this game . Two red card suspensions for Aguero and Fernandinho . Final score 1-3 . #MCICHE
####################
I think now we can all agree Conte&gt;Guardiola 
Costa&gt;Aguero
####################
That's disgusting all round from Man City's players, particularly Aguero!!Shame, coz the match was great to watch. #MCICHE
####################
Fabregas literally didn't do anything and Fernandinho was strangling him hahahaha
####################
Fabregas had Fernandinho in the palm of his hands there!!
####################
Pep not shaking fabregas hand and pulling all his players away from shaking hands with Chelsea, classy
####################
Aguero needs a 10 game ban, if it was Luis Suarez or Diego Costa I'm sure the FA would impose a lengthy ban
####################
Fabregas u bitch do summit
####################
@DJBookaT I'd say it would be a harsh yellow. Clever play by luiz, aguero could've ran around him easily but chose to go to ground
####################
Great tackle from Aguero
####################
fabregas is REALLY mature for that, imagine someone grabbing you by the throat and just ignoring them-jesus
####################
Costa 60......willian 70....Hazard 90......Chelsea on top
####################
On the bright side, no Aguero and Fernandinho when we play them!
####################
That's a shocking challenge from Aguero. Deserved reds for Aguero and Ronaldinho
####################
That was disgraceful from Aguero. What a bell end!
####################
Cheers Aguero &amp; Fernandinho! No Arsenal for you in a couple weeks!
####################
Dumb move Aguero
####################
Horrible finish to the game for #MCFC... https://t.co/3XjQkUc0Sb
####################
City players are lucky that Costa wasn't on that field when that fight broke out! #Chelsea #MCICHE

Great news! https://t.co/LwTnCmtlyR
####################
Very stupid from Fernandinho! Unnecessary!
####################
@nick1geo @premierleague He didnt even lay a hand on Fernandinho ffs
####################
Fernandinho was awful there though. No defense for that.
####################
Lmao Aguero and Fernandinho Scum of the earth and they call Diego Dirty #COYB Top of the league !
####################
FABREGAS IS MAGIC...
####################
@moalajiki you missed where Fabregas slapped him in the face first.
####################
Cesc actually got Fernandinho sent off by doing nothing
####################
Costa &lt; Aguero 

Scores, assists, isn't a cunt.
####################
Aguero that was fucking nasty
####################
That's awful from Aguero and Fernandinho but it's the result of Taylor's refereeing allowing that to build up all game
####################
Aguero and Fernandinho suspended for the Arsenal game. That's a pretty huge deal.
####################
Fernandinho's getting the favela on Fabregas
####################
@FootyAccums say Fabregas threw a punch at Fernandinho and floors him.. how long do you think he would be banned for? I've always wondered.
####################
@MrGeorgeBenson great game by costa today but he'll just never be as good as aguero
####################
Aguero banned for the Arsenal game! Yeahh #COYG
####################
Could Fuck City season up that.. Aguero and Fernandinho Red Cards one of the games against Arsenal
####################
Awww yeh nice one Aguero
####################

####################
Aguero deserves a big match ban for that idc
####################
@fernandinho Piece of shit cunt face #MCICHE
####################
Absolutely idiotic from Aguero, he could've broken Luiz's knee doing that...deserves his ban
####################
Fabregas was shook of Fernandinho
####################
#MCICHE u can tell what Fernandinho is into in the bedroom
####################
FT: Man City 1-3 Chelsea. Cahill og. Costa, Willian, Hazard. City with 2 sent off at the end. Huge moment in the title race. #CFC #MCFC
####################
abeg abeg the only reason Cesc didn't retaliate because he knew Fernandinho would've torn him to pieces
####################
@cjnorris stream I was watching cut out so missed the Hazard goal and red cards. They were all over us in that game
####################
Hahaha man fuck Aguero. Fuck every team except Tottenham tbh
####################
Anthony Taylor wasted this game by not giving city those penalties.... And now frustrated aguero has no control
####################
Cahill OG and Aguero red card. Great start for the fantasy football this weekend!
####################
@__shahi__ the whole squad lost it. Did you see fernandinho
####################
aguero carried all of man citys chances w/him to that tunnel
####################
Clever little slap from Fabregas to set it off.
####################
Don't rate Fabregas he slapped man and tried playing victim smh
####################
Players like Fernandinho think they are real men! But they never met Roy Keane, Vieira,.. #ManCity
####################
@Armaan_Singh18 @ManCity shutup, fabregas with them bollywood moves....
####################
Fernandinho gotta get a 6 match ban for grabbing the throat and aguero is gonna have 5 matches, man cuts season in shambles here
####################
Aguero should be disciplined by the FA
####################
Aguero has always been a cunt, hope he gets a lengthy ban
####################
Aguero on Luiz - not the first time! https://t.co/dJm4sV3zQb
####################
Fernandinho absolutely mugged off Fabregas, there. Wow.
####################
Good job Costa wasn't on the pitch at the end there lololol
####################
Thank fuck Costa wasn't on the pitch during the brawl.
####################
Naa I want the FA to punish these city players! Swear if it was mourinhos team, deff would be suspended Fernandinho
####################
Atleast Fernandinho showed some passion unlike Martial and Ibra who were smiling after losing 4-0
####################
fabregas was taught today. sit yo ass down mate.
####################
Fabregas is a naughty naughty man!
####################
Chelsea have been class this season, shame about the ending towards the end though!
Aguero and Fernando lost their heads! #MCICHE
####################
#Fernandinho what a boy !! Love that !!! #Fabregas is scum !! #MCICHE #Mcfc #CFC #EPL
####################
Nawa pop... Who send Aguero sef?
####################
Fernandinho deserves a 10 match ban for literally assaulting Fabregas. Outside a football pitch that would amount to Battery in Law ! #CFC
####################
How did Fabregas and Chalobah not get ref cards as well? 

Fabregas slapping Fernandinho, while Chalobah pushed Aguero over?! #MCICHE
####################
Disgraceful from Aguero and Fernandinho. #MCICHE
####################
fabregas man, respect for not retaliating. who the fuck does that bald baked bean thing he is
####################
@Longblonde88 Fabregas never even did a thing there. Just checking on his teammate and trying to calm people down.
####################
Pathetic from Fabregas slapping Fernandinho. He wasn't caught. Not good man.. not good #Chelsea #mcfc
####################
City surely win that if De Bruyne puts away sitter or Kun sharper (five shots inside box). Small details though...
####################
Need Fernandinho bullying Fabregas on loop
####################
Kun shoulda do Costa that n get thump up
####################
Aguero and Fernandinho deserve a ban of few matches. Unprofessional cunts
####################
Same with Fernadinho "@Billwizmiz: Good @Ahmed91Gooner: Aguero RED - out v Leicester, Watford &amp; #Arsenal""
####################
2nd half goals from Diego Costa, Willian &amp; Eden Hazard led top of the log Chelsea to a 3-1 victory at Manchester City #SSFootball
####################
Wow was definitely worth waking up early for, 3 points, top of the league, Costa the best in the prem #ForzaChelsea
####################
CUT FROM THE FAVELAS https://t.co/XGf0DlY299
####################
Damn. Got to be a significant ban this.  https://t.co/uxD2z66Mdp
####################
So dirty from Aguero, nasty youttt
####################
That should be about ten games for Aguero
####################
Someone find Aguero and we'll and truly rub it into his face.
####################
Fernandinho is a real bad boy
####################
He was @ the tunnel in an argument with Fernandino https://t.co/WqYv7MB4js
####################
That's a horror tackle from Aguero. There's no excuse for that.
####################
Thank you Sergio Aguero for giving me 0 captain points in #FantasyFootball
####################
How's it working out for him now https://t.co/PKiPXLWWpI
####################
Wtf Aguero should be banned for like 10 games
####################
Cesc making Fernandinho look like a right knob at the end.

#MCICHE
####################
When you need Fernandinho to get booked and he loses it at the end
####################
Aguero the dirty fuck
####################
Losing the game is one thing, losing your composure is another. Bad example for the game. This must be a load off Cahill's chest. #MCICHE
####################
Oh common. https://t.co/7OHwtl5qGd
####################
Fabregas is such a vagina
####################
#MCICHE city take a beating.. Costa on fire today.  Hazard really finished them off .
####################
Proper coward's tackle from Aguero that, went to do him. Arguably worth longer than three game ban
####################
We are all Kun Aguero two footing David Luiz.
####################
Typical Aguero. Such a POS. That makes this win that much sweeter #MCICHE
####################
So aguero and fernandinho banned for our game against them?
####################
Not that I condone that kind of behavior from Aguero...but let's put this into perspective. David Luiz shouldn't EVEN BE ON THE FIELD
####################
City fans have a point re Luiz but De Bruyne finishes that game if he scores the open goal.
####################
@fa surly a red fabregas ? @BBCSport @SkySports @ManCity https://t.co/DOJhElJXPa
####################
Aguero is a fucking cunt, disgusting
####################
Absolutely shocking, poor from Aguero. Expect more from such a good professional
####################
Fernandinho is such a shit player and a stupid person
####################
What a shitty sportsmanship from Fernandinho, what a joke. Eat that red card
####################
What a stupid challenge from Aguero and just as bad from Fernandinho. Chalobah had every right to defend his teammate. #MCICHE
####################
Fernandinho wanted killing Cesc or what? But what Cesc told him just be hurting.
####################
#cfcmc    For once Costa is like https://t.co/nqnUB3SGF6
####################
And they showed fabregas a yellow looool hilarity ensues
####################
Referee started that. Fernandinho ended that. Loving the fact when one scraps we all scrap. Teamwork.
####################
Shocking challenge from aguero. City losing the heads. Would have preferred the draw. But who cares. Come on the red men tomorrow.
####################
Embarrassing from city at the end there, Aguero got away with it before but not today. Excellent win
####################
Hazard power
####################
Fabregas was always unreal at shithousing. Got so many players to react. Threw the pizza at Fergie as well.
####################
FT! City vs. Chelsea 1-3 (Gary Cahill 45' OG., Diego Costa 60', Willian 70, Hazard 90')

#FCHIndonesia #cityvcfc
####################
I've always liked Fabregas when he starts being a bit snide, reminds me of someone i used to play ball with.
####################
Fernandinho and Aguero banned for next week, wonderful! #lcfc
####################

####################
@MeghanMalcolm should've only been aguero and fern but stupid choices for no reason.
####################
Hahahaha Aguero gone for minimum 3 games, too bad he was in my fpl this week as captain
####################
City proper embarrassed themselves there. Tackle from Aguero was shocking.
####################
Aguero red card LOOL RIP my fantasy team for this week lads
####################
Full credit to Fabregas for not swinging for Fernandinho there.
####################
@Kloppholic he slapped Fernandinho first didn't he?
####################
Ultimate composure from Fabregas at the end there to not retaliate to Fernandinho #CFC #MCFC
####################
City proving how they cannot take defeat fucking losers no need for that tackle and Fernandinho absolute cunt fuck city TOP OF THE LEAGUE
####################
Double red card
Aguero and Fernandinho off
####################
That's an awful challenge from Aguero, only intention was to try and hurt Luiz, little scumbag.
####################
Dirty city tramps sore losers! Aguero tackle has got to be one of the worst tackles iv seen! Imagine that was Suarez or Costa! Banned!

####################
What a heist by Costa &amp; Chelsea at Etihad #mciche #PremierLeague
####################
Aguero and Fernandinho out for 3 matches is a big loss to citeh
####################
Costa would've run up on all of these pricks
####################
What a statement by CFC and Conte!Costa sensational, Hazard has rediscovered himself! City's missed chances cost them. #MCICHE
####################
So fucking true this. https://t.co/MENw2lapyr
####################
Chirst Aguero, what were you thinking?
####################
@MattHDGamer foolish but Aguero and certainly deliberate turned a bad loss into a nightmare where is the discipline
####################
@FantasyYIRMA I also captained him for his penalty miss. But NOT for his double last week. -2 again from Aguero as captain. Thats special!!
####################
Never been so happy to NOT have Aguero in my team,  he's also tried to break Luiz leg in the past
####################
Lol Aguero don turn Lu keng.. See kick
####################
Fabregas is the biggest pussy lmfao. Couldn't handle an elite favela like Fernandinho
####################
@ValourLogicxn aguero with one of the worst challenges ive seen in awhile, then a scruff between both teams. Fernandinho being a cock
####################

####################
Fuck off Fernandinho. Ban the twat for 3 games
####################
Lmaoo lucky me, I didn't transfer him in https://t.co/IfsxUxaPvx
####################
If i was fabregas i would've twiss fernando up differently
####################
Fair play Fabregas for keeping his head there. Fernandinho deserved to get banged out grabbing him by the throat over and over. #MCICHE
####################
Disgusting tackle that. Fernandinho is a bit weird aswell
####################
Aguero is a very angry man
####################
Oh wow what a great finish to the game! That throat grab on fabregas almost turned mortal kombat.
####################
@MC_of_A Aguero probably 4+ for that. Already been banned for violent conduct this season, and that tackle is beyond bad.
####################
Props Fabregas for not reacting to hands on his throat twice! #MCICHE  #Chelsea

@BreakingBill Aguero out for Arsenals game. Thanks man. Lol
####################
Aguero that is a dirty challenge. Get him off.
####################
Stupid from Aguero &amp; Fernandinho. Both deserved reds.

Aguero and Ferna just no need man, just made things even  worse

Ugly tackle from Aguero,  fernadiho what a complete wanker #MCICHE
####################
Fernandinho is quite the moron #MCICHE
####################
You know who to blame for that shambles then? Aguero, simple as that...very bad tackle.
####################
Fernandinho best footballer in the league ffs
####################
Funny how Diego Costa was the most composed person on the pitch
####################
Good ting Costa never deh pan d field lol
####################
Savage from Aguero #nofucksgiven
####################
Thats right https://t.co/wnTmlDajXf

####################
y costa not get red too??

ohh.. he already subtitute w batsyuayi
####################
Fernandinho is a dickhead
####################
If Costa was on the pitch when that transpired, he would have brouggt out gun from his socks and murked thise hating niggas.
####################
@WilshTheBaller aguero and Fernandinho missing our game is better bro
####################
The only thing Costa will regret all season is not being on the pitch for the fight
####################
Wait so does this mean Aguero won't play against us?
####################
@TrueGeordieNUFC Wanker of the week SHOULD be Aguero. What a fucking clown
####################
@arseblog Anyone have a gif of Cesc slapping Fernandinho to set him off pushing him?
####################
Aguero said this game won't end until I kill Luiz for fouling me in the first half.
####################
Fabregas gets full marks for not engaging with Fernandinho, who's shoving him repeatedly in the neck. #MCICHE
####################
Wait what did Aguero get a red card?
####################
Aguero red.Great!!Easier to get Costa in now @FantasyFootyFix
####################
But that was disgraceful from Aguero.
####################
Good Lord I'm thankful Costa wasn't involved
####################
Aguero is a dirty prick and Fabregas shouldve also been sent off he slapped Fernadinho first
####################
Fabregas smacking Ferna in the mouth and then ferna shoving him into the ad barrier and getting sent off really sums it up. #mcfc
####################
Needs to be banned for life. Imagine wanting to hurt such a beautiful and harmless Brazilian https://t.co/ggP1wFghDW
####################
Sure thing https://t.co/uLRMvdnB4n
####################
I think aguero should receive 3 game ban.
####################
Fabregas the fucking shithouse. Slapping Fernandinho. Don't mind abit of all that ruckus though, not enough of it anymore in my opinion.
####################
Aguero &amp; Fernandinho lost their heads. Understand their frustration but just silly &amp; unnecessary in that situation.
####################
How pathetic can you get... #Aguero
####################
How pathetic was #fabregas throwing himself over the hoarding
####################
Fernandinho &amp; Aguero both with some disgusting behavior at the end.  Embarrassing to watch.

@johnstongregg @Johno9oc @johnstonev42 disgusting by Aguero!! Has previous with Luiz too https://t.co/QHA8ip0e7v
####################
Shocking from Aguero but what is Fernandinho doing?! Class from Fabregas to keep his hands down mind

Fabregas is still gonna be punished. He slapped Fernandinho first...#EPL
####################
Fernandinho no try kraa but ref was a disgrace throughout the game #MCICHE
####################
@DeadlyKDB 3 maybe more if they think Fernandinho choke on fabregas was worse
####################
Costa would of been sent off if he was still on the pitch
####################
If there is a Black card, Aguero should get it. Wants to spoilthe fine boy of Luiz.
####################
Disgusting tackle from Aguero deserved red, as did fernadinho
####################
Costa be gutted that he missed all that action
####################
Didnt know City taight their worldclass players to lose their cool, even Costa didn't lose his cool LOO
####################
Disgusting challenge from Aguero - spirit of Ben Thatcher in that one.

Fernandinho will probably get a 3 game ban #MCICHE
####################
Aguero is a savage loool
####################
That's vile from aguero

Aguero and Fernandinho will both get three game bans, the third of which is against us.
####################

Aguero and Fernandinho go ahead and get those suspensions.. help your squad drop more points.

Hahahahahahah so fucking funny man. City (Aguero, Fernandinho) just had a complete meltdown. They both will be charged with violent conduct
####################
I've said it before and I'll say it again. Fuck Sergio Aguero. Dirty fuck.
####################
Costa , hazard was on it today #Chelsea
####################
The irony is,if the ref sent Luiz off like he should have,he wouldn't have been on the end of the shocking tackle from aguero
####################
Was I the only one to notice that Bravo made only 1 save and that, after conceeding 3 from 3 SsOT...#BringbackourHart #MCICHE #ThePLShow
####################
@Sir_Zachi apa ini i made him Captain, Costa vice ....but still still no pressure
####################
Aguero with a disgraceful challenge. Costa does that and people would freak!
####################
Delete this!!  Lmao https://t.co/WHRVC62FZu
####################
He gave mine to Hazard https://t.co/KlNFf9V8rY
####################
Horror tackle from Aguero, @GNev2 highlighting why he's my favourite pundit #fucktherules #hithim
####################
That's a fucking disgusting challenge from Aguero. His ban should be in months, not games
####################
@Iamgoldsoup Do not ever compare Aguero &amp; Costa. Next time I will disown you
####################
Too disgusted. https://t.co/RnOAhAceyC
####################
imagine having Aguero in your fantasy team.
####################
Honestly Fabregas' best moment was getting Fernandinho sent off. Smart.
####################
Dramatic end, 2 red cards for Aguero &amp; Fernandinho. City bottled it. #MCICHE
####################
If Aguero's not banned for more than 3 games something is up, that was grim
####################
Aguero should get a serious ban for that shit..
####################
@1Obefiend well he slap Fernandinho first then play victim 'tripping' over the board lol nice one.
####################
Aguero and Fernandinho getting 3-game ban. Out of the Arsenal game. LOVELY scenes
####################
@Ericcunn Yeah but you just know Fabregas said something nasty to him to cause that haha
####################
@cesc4official smacks @fernandinho but commentator says Fabregas did nothing and did well not reacting @premierleague
####################
Fernandinho was having it off
####################
I'm sorry but I am so glad Aguero got sent off for that, not the first time he's done that to Luiz. Last time he got away with it.
####################
I ain't mad at Lil Fox at all. And now Fernandinho finally gets a break from playing every minute of every match.
####################
NEED Zlatan to do what Aguero did so he can have a lengthy ban and we can commence our title charge.
####################
Disgusting behaviour by some City players. 10 match ban for Fernandinho?!?!?
####################
Clearly the commentators not watching the game, Fabregas smacked fernandinho before he grabbed his neck, #bbcfootball
####################
Errr. This is rank. What the hell?? #MCFC https://t.co/F7bOB6Qbjp
####################
Lol Aguero finally gets out of Luiz' pocket and goes straight down the tunnel.
####################
That's disgusting by aguero. Absolute shocker
####################
Aguero confirming what I've always suspected. He's a little prick.
####################
That was really poor from Aguero! Fully meant to hurt Luiz! Costa was probably gutted to be on the bench at the end there! #cityvcfc #EFL
####################
Please https://t.co/3UaUbhDJBs
####################
Looked that costa fucking jumped out of his seat to try and fuck someone up! Mad cunt
####################
Fabergas slapped him.  He deserved everything he got. https://t.co/iCDItlwT2A
####################
That was a horror tackle from Aguero.
####################
@Chaddy93 Aguero's losing his touch pal
####################
commentators u completely miss fabregas slap fernandinho face. then he just make poker face. playing innocent #MCICHE
####################
Credit to Fabregas, didn't react, despite being grabbed by the throat and pushed into the crowd.
####################
FT: Man City 1-3 Chelsea | Cahill 45' (o.g) - Costa 57', Willian 70', Hazard 90'.
####################
Fernandinho absolutely hilarious
####################
Imagine Costa done what Aguero done there, wow
####################
@Kloppholic fabregas slapped him in the face to initiate it.
####################
Fernandinho and aguero have had shockers there. Terrible challenge and then the afters from Fernandinho was childish.
####################
I swear that's the second time Aguero has done a mad challenge on Luiz,  happened a few years back
####################
Hahahaha we're top of the league RT @CFCInAmerica: Kun(t) Aguero.
####################
Dirty scumbag City fans trying to get at Fabregas then
####################
@Chris_Hewitson Fair play to Fabregas for not reacting.
####################
city could not accept being outclassed and shown wat they really are.fabregas really cool to not retaliate.aguero should be banned4 6matches
####################
Ugly end. Never like to see sportsmanship go sour. Aguero did a huge disservice for his team to clattter Luiz and get the suspension. #CFC
####################
The agberos struck today. 2 red cards. Thank God I haven't put Aguero in my squad
####################
Nice one Aguero you muppet! #FantasyFootballProblems
####################
Fabregas shld be seeing red not fernandinho
####################
Take a bow https://t.co/D8fvFEeleR
####################
Fernandinho told cesc "oii fam shut up and hold a seat"
####################
City sore losers! Really showed their class there! Fuck off Aguero
####################
Horrific tackle from Aguero. Disgusting behavior from Fernandinho - Kudos to Fabregas for not reacting. #ManCityvsChelsea #EPL
####################
I think fe....ho....deserves more than a red,thanks to aguero ...the whole team deserves a red though #mancityvchelsea
####################
Top of the league...
Fabregas was fantastic
####################
Class @cesc4official for not retaliating https://t.co/t30g7IwJGh
####################
Oh wow imagine if costa did that challenge #protected
####################
Aguero's challenge was bad even for Sunday league standards, disgusting
####################
@darrenrichman @Tr16ia especially when its City missing Aguero and Fernandinho (for 3 matches?)
####################
That Aguero tackle was basically for the decisions which went against him during the whole match. Luiz one was a clear trip.
####################
When last did bravo even keep a clean sheet
####################
good job costa wasnt still on the pitch at the end ^___^
####################
Aguero fucking hates David Luiz
####################
Hey Pep... Aaron Mooy is decent with his feet, why not try him in goal, Bravo is fucking garbage... #mcfc #cfc #joehart #headsgone
####################
I expect the FA to sanction Fernandinho
####################
I dont think the suspension will end there from that

Fabregas might not of punched him but raised his hand to Fernandinho
####################
Fair play to Cesc Fabregas there. No reaction and kept a level head. Embarrassing from the Man City players though #MCICHE
####################
That's a truly awful challenge from Aguero. City completely lost their heads at the end there!
####################
I need replays from all angles of that whole incident hahahah https://t.co/gc4DviqdH8
####################
"@Lie_cann: Why is Fernandinho being sent off now? #MCICHE" you can't do what he was doing to fabregas.  He needs to go
####################
Sergio Aguero's red card means he will miss the leicester city, watford and Arsenal game #Bigblow
####################
Disgusting from Aguero. Becomes a little prick when he doesn't get his way. #MCICHE
####################
The FA should suspend Fernandinho ..
####################
He sold that red card for $0.99....twas a Black Friday deal!!! https://t.co/VNJnfqe3kb
####################
DIEGO COSTA THE GOD!!!!
####################
Class performance, class Reaction https://t.co/injF7h4emY

@JamieLloyd95 for Fabregas diving over the advertising hoarding?
####################
@ClassyAguero 

"Classy Aguero"....  scree.
####################
Costa looks like he eats humans for dinner
####################
Guardiola completely ignores Fabregas. Fabregas tried to shake his hands twice but Pep acted as if Cesc wasn't there
####################
Really ugly watching the replay of Fernandinho attacking Fabregas and Fab refusing to respond. City player should get punished severely.
####################
Lengthy ban coming for Fernandinho
####################
Fernandinho looking at a lengthy suspension. What a bell end he is.
####################
Aguero should still b punished for that tackle.  

Pure evil.
####################
The day of beautiful counter attacks. https://t.co/NSQjcBrKYS
####################
fernandinho needs it calm it mate
####################
Fernandinho was stupid to fall for Fabregas trying to wind him up
####################
Got to say, Fabregas was impressively mature there. Could have very easily and understandably retaliated.
####################
Refs got both reds spot on for me. Can't help but like Aguero but that was a disgraceful tackle
####################
If Diego Costa had done what Aguero just did he'd you'd never hear the end of it. 10 match ban guaranteed #campaignagainstchelsea
####################
Aguero and fernandinho won't play against arsenal...
####################
That tackle by #aguero was disgusting.  A 3 match ban isn't enough for a challenge like that #MCICHE
####################
Aguero, Iheanacho &amp; Fernandinho deserve at least a 3 game ban, can't take the loss like men but I'm sure the media won't bat an eye #MCICHE
####################
FABREGAS is a GENTLE BOY. @sureboynazz_
####################
Fantastic counter attacking display from Chelsea. Costa brilliant. Guardiola exposed as a fraud.
####################
And he just hugged Pedro LOOOOOOOOOL
####################
Fabregas was scared of Fernandinho uno
####################
Retweeted Premier League (@premierleague):

RED CARD Aguero is sent off for a challenge on David Luiz #MCICHE
####################
Fernandinho dirty cunt, fabregas did nothing wrong and he puts his hand round his throat, hope he serves at least 3 match ban
####################
Aguero and Fernandinho obviously didn't want to face the champions
####################
Aguero and Fernandino both sent off at the end haha.

City's 2 best players this season.
####################
Haha you little scumbag Aguero! The wheels have come off there! Absolute #Headsgone

Niiiice. No Aguero and Fernandinho against us

Screw you Aguero. RIP my #FPL

What an utter C#*!T Fabregas is always seems to get away with it too
####################
Very unlike Pep-managed sides to lose the plot like that at the end. Aguero getting sent off sums up his day from those misses. #MCICHE
####################
Fernandinho hardly a saint either, mind
####################
Fernandinho potentially facing a ban for his behaviour
####################
DIEGO COSTA WAS A PEACEMAKER!

Fernandinho's behavior was a disgrace

Massive respect to Fabregas for staying calm and letting Fernando embarrass himself

Conte has Chlesea in top form. They look unstoppable right now. Hazard and Costa are back to their best. Fuck.
####################
Fernandinho and Aguero ejected.
####################
Pathetic and disgusting from Aguero and Fernandinho #MCICHE
####################
Awful from Aguero. The irony, of course, is that Luiz shouldn't have been there - should have been off before half time.
####################
Aguero killed this game
####################
#MCICHE Aguero deserved that push from chalobah, and fernandiho deserves a fine for that, well done fabregas for not reacting
####################
Cie cieeeee two red cards. Some people need to go their mama #Aguero #Fernandinho #CFC #KTBFFH #MCICHE
####################
If fernadinho held costa the way he did with febregas we would be Watching world war 4 #MCICHE
####################
@Kloppholic hit fernandinho a wee slap first though.
####################
@C0reyDixon I meant in terms of this game, we can do without Aguero but it's Fernandinho we'll miss
####################
@Aontaigh he said chalobah was right to push aguero he doesn't care what the rules are and other shit
####################
Aguero is most captained.
####################
Fernandinho grabbed fabregas' neck three times, I would have spun is jaw
####################
If Fernandinho is not banned for atleast 3 games I will be baffled
####################
Aguero will pick up a 4 match ban for that totally unnecessary challenge with the game lost. Flights booked to Argentina for Xmas?
####################
@ColinDeval what a horror tackle from Aguero!
####################
Aguero you are a great player. No need for that! Ahaaaa. Diego is the beast! #MCICHE
####################
Vity will play better without Aguero
####################
Awful from aguero! Not the first time he should have been sent off against luiz! Fernandinho that is just dreadful!
####################
Actually pleased with Aguero getting sent off. Makes getting him out for Costa a no brainer #FPL
####################
If Costa made the challenge aguero did, he'd have been executed, never mind sent off
####################
Kudos to Fabregas for not reacting to all Fernandinho did. Maturity
####################
Animalistic and Immatured Fernandinho. Great character by Fabrigas . #MCICHE
####################
Only a matter of time. City have all right to be frustrated. But they should have kept cool. Now Aguero and Fernandinho both gone. #MCICHE

Decisions decisions, who to replace Aguero with, Costa or Kane?
####################
How the fuck fabregas kept calm I have no idea
####################
That aguero tackle though. Deserves a longer ban
####################
Why Fernandinho didn't pull up Toni Kroos after 7-0 beating like that
####################
Cahill 1 - 3 Chelsea
####################
That's what we call pepper body reactions from Aguero and Fernandiho
####################
Straight red card for Aguero &amp; Fernandinho. Both miss the game against Arsenal.
####################
Amazing the difference Conte has made to Costa
####################
Give credit to Costa, playing as per normal but still keeping in check that temper.

Fuck Fabregas, hopefully he get a ban that cunt
####################
City lose, De Bruyne misses a sitter and Aguero + Fernandinho sent off what a treat
####################
A minute of silence for those that captained Aguero
####################
Let it now be said with complete certainty that Aguero just can't do it when it matters.
####################
Wouldn't be like Guardiola's team to act like spoiled brats when they lose. Aguero &amp; Fernandinho should get lengthy bans #MCICHE
####################
Fernandinho has got to get a HUGE ban! How many times did he raise his hands to Fabregas?!
####################
Fernandinho grabbing Cesc by the throat and pushing him over the hoardings. Should be at least 3 matches #MCICHE

Aguero went in with intent to kill Luiz. 
That's 7 matches at least.
####################
Aguero was hopeless and de bruyne couldn't score when he had an empty net in front of him
####################
When do Arsenal play City I pray to God, Aguero &amp; Fernandinho is banned.
####################
When your team loses, you don't get to be the best player on the pitch... to Kevin de Bruyne
####################
Aguero's red card was fine, Fernandinho let himself down, credit to Fabregas for not reacting #MCFC #CTID
####################
this chalobah guy wanted beef, he prolly looked at aguero like "fam are you mad?"
####################
Fernandinho' a little rat
####################
That so dirty by aguero

Good thing Costa wasn't on the pitch when the fight broke out

Wow absolutely no class from Aguero and Fernandinho. Take that L tho #KTBFFH

####################
It Is A Good Thing Costa Wasn't On
####################
@1Obefiend but how could not Fernandinho react when Cesc did a cheeky quick slap on him. still gg
####################
There's not reacting but Cesc saw Fernandinho pull him aside and start choking him... He was too shook to react..!
####################
@hailcheaters Now I can finally get Costa/Kane in!
####################
Man City completely lost it at the end of the game. Aguero and Fernandinho. Red cards.That could be vital as they are important players #cfc

####################
I thought the ref had a good game minus the David Luiz first half bit. Both red cards right disgusting tackle from aguero
####################
Costa for collect red if e dey field too
####################
Why was Aguero given a red? Momentum took his right foot off the ground. He tried to make a block. Not a red card IMO. #MCICHE #PL
####################
Ffs I captained aguero instead of Costa... aguero you spastic
####################
@TrueGeordieNUFC if de bruyne put in that open goal we would've lust. Thank fuck.
####################
Aguero &amp; Fernandinho will miss the game against us! Beautiful. Hopefully we pick up the 3 points against them. #MCICHE
####################
Kante is the difference

Horrific challenge from Aguero #SoreLoser
####################
#aguero you dirty fuck!
####################
on the other end , I'd like to see @FA take some action on Pep (touchline antics) and Fernandinho
####################
Myself, last minute decision https://t.co/zl8KaPWgC8
####################
Fam Fabregas is a prick, he grabbed mans face
####################
So glad Luiz got snapped and Fabregas got slapped up
####################
Wee bitta revenge from Aguero ma man
####################
True he made a huge mistake by selling Joe Hart and cos he needed a so called ball playing goalie called Bravo @footballmcd@footballmcd
####################
@5liveSport @bbc5live Fabregas slapped Ferna and walks away? Poor refereeing throughout. And as for Conte's behaviour? Inflammatory
####################
KDB and Aguero cost Manchester City this game.
####################
Aguero causes heartbreak amongst all the FPL managers who captained him.....
####################
Kante played?
####################
And there could, and maybe SHOULD, have been a Chelsea player or two sent off as well https://t.co/hAi8HM0fBr
####################
Always has been https://t.co/u7zarfVCdQ
####################
#MCICHE Lessons : 1. Chelsea are in the form of their lives. 2. Pep made a huge mistake letting Hart leave. 3. Aguero looked tired.
####################
If costa did that he would be banned for the rest of the season
####################
Costa MOTM by far
####################
Jesus that's a bit tasty https://t.co/xU8mxnNR3C
####################
@RishiPatel96 fabregas is a fucking cheat
####################
fab was para when Fernandinho pulled up on him ehn
####################
@stighefootball 3, but Fernandinho choking Cesc twice and pushing him over the board worse imo...granted no injury...
####################
Well that was entertaining, Peps city discipline awful, Aguero losing his nut, I wouldn't let otamendi mind my dog! Awful defender
####################
That augero challenge was disgusting and Fernandinho lost his head. What a win for us
####################
Bravo thinks he is CR7 in disguise
####################
@SibsMUFC filthy from them both. Fabregas never even retaliated.
####################
Scumbag Fernandinho and cry babies Man city. Horrible! #CHEMCI
####################
Fernandinho shouldn't  have pushed  cesc like that
####################
Aguero plays like shit then goes and gets a red
####################
FABREGAS DID ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! This is what you need from players. No reaction at all. @cesc4official fucking love you
####################
Fernandinho and Aguero will miss the Arsenal game. Good Good.
####################
What's Fernandinho playing at? #InappropriateBehaviour #MCICHE
####################
Costa immense 2nd half. Bullied citeh. Luiz superb too. Willian back with big impact. #CFC
####################
Unreal response from Cesc, Fernandinho grabbing his throat 4 times &amp; no retaliation from Cesc whatsoever.
####################
wuuuu.  eden hazard handsome ahhh.  skill pun cantik
####################
Aguero should have 2 red cards today! Should miss 6 games the dirty cunt
####################
Fair play to to Cesc Fabregas for keeping his cool against the thug (Fernandinho).
####################
Fabregas should be banned as well, slapping like a pussy
####################
Finally Fabregas will play. #MNCCHE but what the fuck was that last minute. Way to go #Fabregas. Staying calm.
####################
Aguero definitely has an issue with David Luiz. It's hilarious.
####################
nasty challenge from Aguero on David Luiz, city lack of discipline
####################
That was a nice old fashioned tussle. Good to see, apart from the waist high challenge from Aguero #minuspointsindreamteam
####################
Fabregas is a pussy, but he was very smart there to get Fernandinho sent off. Ice cold.
####################
What is Fernandinho doing there? Disgusting. Hands around Fabregas' throat, pushes him over the advertising board. What a disgrace.
####################
Aguero fucked me over
####################
#MCICHE Otamendi, Cahill &amp; Stones worst defenders in the Premier League?
####################
Fernandinho also sent for a run-in with Fabregas #MciChe 1-3
####################
@JamieJackson___ wouldn't say hammering. Key moment de bruyne.
####################
Lol he should have punched costa in the face while he was at it
####################
Cesc what a man just lets Fernandinho abuse him and doesn't react. He's lucky Costa wasn't on the field cause he would be in the hospital
####################
Manchester City, Lose 3 points, and Aguero and Fernandinho in the next 3 games

####################
Aguero is an absolute disgrace. Appalling scenes.
####################
@JacobSouthKlein Not at all what I want to see, just pointing that out. Aguero for a 5 or 6 match ban for me.
####################
FABRAGAS STARTED IT https://t.co/IMy779J5I1
####################
@Crich83 I saw that too. That's probably why fernandinho got so upset.
####################
Aguero sent off that was dirty
####################
@TinokieY Bravo is pure poes
####################
AGUERO'S LOST THE PLOT
https://t.co/zBJ8b7yWMR
####################
Shame a great contest has ended so poorly, Aguero the culprit with a terrible tackle. Can't excuse it, however the game has panned out.
####################
Aguero's frustration has been piling up since he got benched against Barca. It's not gonna work with Pep. And he's not been finishing
####################
What's the difference between that Aguero tackle &amp; every David Luis tackle ? Same way they cheat #MUFC every week
####################
Costa before his goal was complete wank. After scoring it, he came to life.
####################
Hate the bloke. https://t.co/v7BvSpVKE1
####################
Aguero and Fernandinho will miss the game against us
####################
Fernandinho and Aguero miss the game against us, we better win

Normally u would see Fabregas in the mix fighting,  that time he was trying to calm the situation.
####################
@IrishPhan61 nah I agree mate! I like aggression...it's the bad sportsmanship that I don't like...but he's shown Aguero up today!
####################

####################
Make I just sell Aguero from my FPL!!!!
####################
@ManCity @ChelseaFC Fucking referee!!!!!! Everyone saw Fabregas hit Fernaginu's cheek first! But Fucking referee gave red card to Fernaginu!
####################
Disgusting challenge by Aguero. Fernandinho is a moron. Embarrassing end to a game. #MCICHE
####################
Lol fabregas trolling, and falling into the stands. Same old pep team though. Sore losers. Trying to get pens and people sent off.
####################
Guardiola bought a defender who can't defend (stones) and a keeper who can't save (Bravo) #Guardiola #MCICHE
####################
#Aguero is absolutely world class but he has that in him. Disgusting. Fabregas lucky to stay on for slapping Fernandinho first. #bbcfootball
####################
Guardiola's teams have always been over entitled pieces of shit. Serves them right. Aguero should get a 5 match ban at least. Shame.
####################
Aguero and Fernandinho to miss 3 games...not good for city
####################
Moses denies Aguero a certain goal after De Bruyne had flashed a low delivery across the six-yard box, outstanding defending. #MCICHE
####################
Aguero...Man City...disappointed, bad sportsmanship. After such a good game to do that... #PremierLeague
####################
@fernandinho Disgusting !!! Grow a pair of balls and play fairly like a man. Bloody arse !!
####################
Diego Costa is the premier league Man of the Match. #CFC
####################
City lost the plot there. Absolutely disgusting from those City players. Aguero deserves a massive ban for that - horrible.
####################
Aguero also lost his head with that Sunday league challenge
####################
Fernandinho x Cesc too. RT @phoenixfeet: Aguero should be disciplined by the FA
####################
If Costa did what Fernandinho or Aguero just did he would be banned for 8 matches
####################
Great. Aguero will get a 4 game ban for that, meaning his first game back will be......Liverpool.
####################
If I was in charge Fernandinho would've been well within his rights to chin Fabregas there.
####################
Fernandinho completely lost it. Deserves to have the book thrown at him #banned
####################
Man city are a disgrace. Awful challenge by Aguero #sorelosers
####################
@PauloSimao55 I think he has something against Luiz. Filth. Him and costa swapped roles
####################
# 5 city players should never play football again fernandinho life time ban keep them players out of football
####################
@jimiecheng oh so Fernandinho choking Fabregas and pushing him over the ads board is okay
####################
Fabregas definitely said something to fenandinho that tipped him off cause boy he looked pissed
####################
LUCKY COSTA WASN'T STILL ON HE WOULD OF CAUGHT A BODY
####################
Here's the moment Fabregas slaps Fernandinho to set him off #chelsea #Mcfc #epl https://t.co/1aAVnCzHsr
####################
You think a man can grab my neck like that? Fabregas has no bottle
####################
Swap Aguero, Fernandino and Guardiola for Rooney, Ibrahimovic and Jose and United would be banned and questions in the House.
####################
That puts Aguero out of Man City v Arsenal. As well as games against Leicester and Watford. Costly. #MCFC #CFC
####################

####################
Aguero fucking hates David Luiz like, proper horror show #MCFCvCFC
####################
I wonder what Cesc told Fernandinho to make him lose his head
####################
Aguero has done this twice to Luiz.. remember the stamp in the FA cup a few years back?
####################
If Costa did what Aguero did, I guarantee there would be Twitter meltdown! Disgusting little prick. Forget his talent.
####################
@ralpha060461 ....Someone should have knocked Fernandinho out.....dirty bastard!!
####################
Fabregas might get a ban too if the FA looks into it

How do you have Navas, Kolarov and Clitchy, and still lose to counter attacks.

####################
Fernandinho deserves a lengthy ban for that. How many times does he want to grab someone by the throat who isn't reacting in any way
####################
Oh, and Eden Hazard is the best football player in the league too.
####################
City loosed. Aguero and fernadinho red carded facing ban I guess.. My weekend is getting better and better bruh.
####################
FPL getting to yuh fam lol https://t.co/6W64vqpBM7
####################
How long are Fernandinho and Aguero suspended for?!?!?!?!?!?!
####################
Fernandinho did to Cesc what Arsenal fans have wanted to for the longest
####################
@philmcnulty cesc with the cheeky slap and then stood like butter wouldn't melt. Fernandinho overreacted though!!
####################
Fabregas with the best dive in memory. 
Good game, poor defending by both teams and a ref who was shocking.
#mancity #chelsea
####################
What a prick Fernandinho is.
####################
FERNANDINHO AS WELL, HE WANTED TO BEEF EVERY CHELSEA PLAYER
####################
Aguero is a foolish striker aswear
####################
Eden Hazard's haters have disappeared!! https://t.co/jDjZTUJXV8
####################
Considering transferring #aguero from #FantasyFootball team...might be a good idea, don't you think?  #MCICHE
####################
Pretty sure guardiola blanked all Chelsea players but Pedro (including fabergas straight up). Mourinho is a bad loser they say?
####################
3 match bans for you @aguerosergiokun @fernandinho https://t.co/xrBDJMcdjo
####################
City had many chances to score, De Bruyne and Aguero just couldn't get it in the net... These things happen

Absolutely shocking challenge from Aguero on Luiz and a red card. That's a four-game ban.Fernandinho sent off too!! #MCICHE
####################
Bad losers City.  Fernandinho is well out of order.  #MCICHE #Chelsea
####################
Something tells me Aguero and Fernandinho will miss Arsenal's match aye?
####################
Aguero gonna miss the Arsenal game how sad
####################
Aguero will miss the game against us due to a straight red card which will be a 3 game ban! #AFC
####################
I cant believe that Aguero challenge
####################
RED CARD Aguero is sent off for a challenge on David Luiz

Fernandinho is also shown a red card #MCICHE
####################
Aguero always been a dirty bastard... bout time he was called out for it
####################
Diego Costa Know what you own, and know why you own it.|Peter Lynch #HumanDesignIndonesia.com #dmulyan27

Costa is so legit! Glad to see Hazard with his free footing football. Special lads
####################
Fernandinho's a little rat
####################
And I just transferred aguero in my team.... such a twat
####################
Aguero and Fernandinho out for the Arsenal game, lovelyyy
####################
Aguero and Fernandinho sent off. 3 games suspension will miss Arsenal game. Fucking idiots.
####################
Courtois kept us in this. Made some important saves at 1-0 down, but that de Bruyne miss was so so soooooo crucial.
####################
Thx Hazard https://t.co/mXgz5zdAv5
####################
What an ending! Fabregas is too cool #MCFCvCFC
####################
Shocker from Aguero

Him and Fernandinho with a 3 game ban is good for us though
####################
No talk of Pep being being a fraud please. They decimated us until Costa's goal. Luckiest Chelsea performance I've ever seen
####################
Wow aguero that was .... FILTHY !!!!
####################
Fair play to Fabregas for not responding to the stupid aggression from Fernandinho.
####################
Is #bravo really better than #hart
####################
Four game ban for Aguero, too. Missing Leicester away and Arsenal at home.
####################
I will not defend Aguero for that straight red, all I will say is that David Luiz shouldn't have been on the pitch  at that point.
####################
Fernandinho is also shown a red card #MCICHE #premierleague
####################
Two red cards for city's Aguero and Fernandinho....  @ChelseaFC now seating comfortably on the top of the league. #Epl
####################
No Aguero and Fernandinho against Arsenal , cheers lads #RedCard

Fernandinho bringing out some favela type shit
####################
Wow. No sympathy whatsoever for City. Such a hideous display. Savage behaviour especially from Fernandinho. Sham. #MCIvCHE
####################
Shocking challenge from Aguero. Can't argue with anything that happened there
####################
@philmcnulty think city lost it.  Chelsea stayed in control. Especially fabregas having been grabbed round throat &amp; pushed
####################
Cesc Fabregas gets Fernandinho sent off with what can only be described as Spanish tactics. Graduate from the school of Sergio Busquets

@NikoReg_ Things got heated for sure. Aguero with the jump/scissor kick cleats up... just ridiculous
####################
They were all having a nigga moment but Fabregas applied the white man formula
####################
@elTav I think Fabregas slapped him in the melle so will be interesting to see what the camera review shows
####################
Still on the top! But that fight is just unbelievable! #MCICHE https://t.co/0Zdb1XAvUX
####################
Fernandinho is a low key mass murderer you know.
####################
@premierleague fabregas is a class act
####################
Disaster for City who see Aguero and Fernandinho receive a red card each.
####################
Wow. Choking fabregas #MCICHE
####################
Horrible challenge by Aguero; vicious and cowardly. Twat.
####################
@AntoinetteJr gweh! I was slowly catching you too. Hazard bagged at least
####################
That's massive. Aguero and Fernandinho will miss the Arsenal game now!

Not me, phew, but now I have to sell him again meh https://t.co/RZegLGbdac
####################
City are cunt . Pep is a cunt . Aguero a cunt . Fernandinho a cunt.
####################
Aguero and Fernandinho were disgraceful. No class whatsoever. Couldn't take their loss.
####################
Just imagine if De Bruyne had scored that open goal chance. Could've been 4, 5-0 to the pricks.
####################
hahahaha fabregas thought he was being chilled and he got pushed over lol
####################
Chalobah doing bits dropping aguero
####################
Fabregas is a little scared puppy with the balls size of a peanut #MCICHE
####################
All part of Pep's master plan, highlights week defence, needs another centre mid and let's aguero chill out for 3 games #genius #mcfc
####################
Fair from Fabregas to just take that, Aguero you bastard for getting minus points
####################
respect Cesc, he should have banged Fernandinho
####################
Eden Hazard. What a player.
####################
Cesc handling Fernandinho's aggression really well.

Raaa u can tell Fernandinho is from the favelas he wasn't having none of it.

####################
Costa loves it https://t.co/1TPS8GBZ8r
####################
I missed the Aguero tackle
####################
Aguero always had for Luiz I remember that same two footed challenge three years ago in the community shield and never got a booking
####################
Bless God https://t.co/7P5VOAcixS

Fernandinho muppet
####################
Suddenly feeling quite justified for dropping Aguero in favour of Costa in my @OfficialFPL team.
####################
Wtf Fernandinho that was horrific
####################
Rooney would be banned from football if he did what either aguero or fernandinho did.
####################
Aguero and Fernandinho, arguably City's most vital players behind KDB, shown direct reds! Can it get any better? #MCICHE
####################
@pokeefe1 sly slap from fabregas too what a surprise
####################

Fernandinho and Aguero will miss the Arsenal game coming soon
####################
Fernandinho and Aguero will miss the game against us. Look forward to Yaya and Iwobi's mate scoring.
####################
They've just lost Aguero and Fernandinho for 3 games
####################
Senseless beyond belief from Man City, 3-1 down with seconds left and they end up losing Aguero and Fernandinho for 3 games
####################
#MCICHE after that challenge Aguero should be ban for 6 months. The guy should be arrested, nasty little scumbag.

I love Aguero as a player, but he deserves the book throwing at him for that 'tackle' on Luiz. Disgusting.

@fkhanage same for Fernandinho. Violent conduct

@889BrilaFM Aguero is a coward useless same time spoil my day for me #footballliveng
####################
You're my favourite person @fernandinho
####################
@DailyRender can we shift our focus to how bad bravo actually is. Conceding twice near post and a grounder to the far. I can save those easy
####################
Fernandinho That's 10 Match Ban !!!!
####################
Fabregas behaved like a respected person... had tht been me, I wd hv kicked tht black b**** in the a**

 #CHEMCI
####################
Aguero deserves red card for the dangerous tackle but Fernandinho's actions are a disgrace there.
####################
Random fact... I got a Red Card in October doing @fernandinho ... Got suspended for 4 games, appeals got it reduced to one. Love IT! #EPL
####################
Aguero's a scumbag on the lowww
####################
The hell! What the hell? Just when I thought it  couldn't get worse for us... Fernandinho, the heck did Fabregas say? &amp; Aguero? Reckless.
####################
It's alright @ManCity, Aguero kicked David Luiz instead of a bottle, so we won't face serious reprecussions as per the @FA logic.
####################
Aguero is an asshole lol
####################
Fabregas in the middle as usual but coming out looking like the innocent party the little shit.
####################
Pep and City losing it. 100% tilt. Fabregas back. Costa on fire. Aguero and Fernandinho completely losing it. LOVE IT
####################
This!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! https://t.co/mBHGVFgQbz
####################
Disgraceful reactions from City players. Unacceptable. I don't know why fabregas got a yellow. Fernandinho was chocking and shoving him.#CFC
####################
That was awful from Aguero, frustration but it's a deserved red card. Well it all kicked off, well done Chalobah did everything right then,
####################
aguero dirty bastard
####################
Pep must really really regret letting Joe Hart go now . Claudio Bravo is by far the worst keeper in epl #ssfootball #epl

Should be a huge ban for Fernandinho #MCICHE
####################
KDB and Aguero should have made it 3-0.
####################
Horribly entertaining. 
Fabregas smacks guy in face.
"Fabregas did well here." - graeme le saux
Shut up. #MCFCvCFC
####################
A point made by my friend. Both Aguero and Fernandinho will be out of the game against Arsenal. Pep will be furious
####################
Y'all tryna say you didn't see Fabregas slap him smh
####################
Respect to fabregas for not reacting to that stupid attack
####################
Look at that tackle from Aguero on Luiz. What a disgrace!!
####################
What did Aguero and Fernandinho do?
####################
Disgusting by aguero
####################
Fabregas is soft a man took a little push n fell over the boards all dramatic
####################
Fabregas is a disgusting piece of work. Sly little slap to the face. #MCICHE
####################
Aguero challenge was nuts. 96th minute, losing 3-1, pointless.
####################
fernandinho is a complete twat, no need for that, aguero yeah should've been sent off but fernandinho just dragged it on :/
####################
@Ratingggg grabbed Fabregas by the neck 4 times and shoved him over a advertising board
####################
Fuck off Aguero. Smh.
####################
Otamendi, Kolarov, Silva, Navas, Clichy all just not good enough for City.
####################
Already spending my Aguero money #FPL https://t.co/yMtcGYvvHV
####################
Argie Sergio Aguero saw two Brazlians score against his team so he twatted one.
####################
I think I forgot to make changes to my FPL team and Aguero's still my captain. Bloody hell!!
####################
I make Chelsea favourites to win the league due to hazard and Costa mainly Costa and the goals he scores
####################
Aguero Big drop kick on david Luiz there like
####################
Everyone hates Fabregas
####################
They didn't see that. He's actually a bastard. RT @j3thr0v1c: FABREGAS SLAPPED HIM FIRST
####################
Hey @FA dick faces, give Aguero 3-match ban and Fernandinho 6-match ban
####################
Cool as you like from Fabregas not reacting, knew Fernandinho was walking already
####################
If you look closer, Fabregas actually soft slapped Fernadinho first. That's why he reacted like that. #MCICHE #PremierLeague
####################
Love Fernandinho what a guy
####################
Fabregas did well not to react
####################
How about that smack by Fabregas #MCICHE
####################
Fernandinho got slapped by Fabregas. It's only right he hits him back. Fuck that
####################
I hope that Aguero ban is reviewed and they add a couple matches.
####################
Remember when Aguero 2-footed Luiz's arse
####################
@ManCity bunch of sore losers hahahaha. @fernandinho should be ashamed of himself aswell. Behaving like a fucking child
####################
@qxdriz i love you hazard
####################
Disgusting behaviour from all at @ManCity. Horrendous from Aguero, deserves far longer then 3 games, as does Fernandinio.
####################
I'd fine Aguero and Fernandinho. At least 3 match bans for embarrassing reactions and tackles with 30 seconds left
####################
Hate saying it but fair play to Fabregas for not retaliating #ManCityvsChelsea
####################
Fernandinho grabbed fabregas' neck three times, I would have spun his jaw
####################
@MuhdZakii19 fernandinho fucking bastard. Absolutely cunt
####################
Shame on you Aguero. Wow. Terrible, needs to be more than 3 games that one. Terrible losers
####################
Fabregas assited Fernandinho for red

####################
Not the first time he's done it either. Absolute knee breaker! About time Aguero sees red for tackles like these:

https://t.co/NrZ1vWP0rt
####################
Stop talking about Conte master class. If Aguero and De Bruyne scored their clear moments we would`ve seen something like 3-0 to MC
####################
When you realise you had aguero as your fantasy  football captain.. https://t.co/0o8p1d18Nv
####################
Fabregas knows fine well Fernandinho is getting sent off, just lets him grab his neck and push him over the board
####################
@Empyre_Stocka aguero gave no fucks

@oslrespect you can't blame the referee for missing your chances and getting punished on the break. Aguero disgusting!

I envy chelsea for having a good CF like Costa.

Man city.. aguero and fernandinho are lucky zouma isn't there to help chalobah bully. They aren't about that life. They'd get smacked
####################
However, the basis of it was a horrendous tackle by Aguero. Needs to be more than a 3 match ban.
####################
Fabregas there taking all that shit from Fernandinho and doing nothing back, he's done well there
####################
Both Fernandinho and Aguero given straight RED. Will miss the game against @Arsenal
####################
Fair play to Fabregas for not reacting to Fernandinho's shit housery there!

Aguero's the dirtiest player in the league. Loves a filthy, cowardly tackle but is injured for 4 months whenever anyone makes one on him
####################
The ref was so biased all game . Someone basically assaulted Aguero after that challenge and Ihenacho was getting pushed around too
####################
Wtf is wrong with Fernandinho..

####################
LOL Cesc played Fernandinho like a fiddle.

Costa makes that Aguero challenge he goes prison, 5-10 stretch.

####################
FUMING FUMING FUMING AGUERO AND FERNANDINHO OUT THE ARSENAL GAME
####################
How funny that the roles were reversed. Usually its Costa as the villain but today it was Aguerro. Did not see that coming!
####################
also kind of worried about Matic, Costa and Pedro injuries , hope they all recover by next week
####################
Nasty that by aguero
####################
Dirty scumbags Man City are can't hack losing so go divvy at everyone, that challenge by aguero should see more then just 3 games banned!
####################
Fabregas fell down, because he had no clue that the advertising board was behind him. Huh, classic Fabregas.
####################
Amazing how Chalobah abi who grabs fernandinho by the neck also and doesnt get sent off.
####################
Wait, Aguero for Kane since I have Hazard?
####################
Sweetest of victories I've ever witnessed. Guardiola can't take it. Disgraceful from Aguero and Fernandinho, rightly sent off.
####################
Aguero 

What a cunt
####################
I'm embarrassed and ashamed....Bravo granny! https://t.co/rut7nkIPp0
####################
This is soccer, there's always emotions involved! What Fernandinho did was dumb though, it was just unnecessary.
####################
De Bruyne's miss was the defining moment of the match
####################
@Marlinaayu brilliant counter by hazard and Willian!
####################
fernandinho did a lot for fabregas' distance completed stats with that series of pushes
####################
The more I watch that Aguero challenge the worse it gets

Three game ban coming up
####################
Kevin De Bruyne's clearance onto the bar gave Chelsea hope
####################
@rohan_connolly shocking tackle from Aguero !

disgrace to football Fernandinho
####################
sweaaaar https://t.co/cUOFQSZVCr

Wow, what a poor tackle from Aguero. Never seen him see red like that.
####################
Honestly that Fernandinho incident is horrid. If that's Costa it never ends. Fortunately Costa scored and assisted instead
####################
Once a cunt, always a cunt. What a disgraceful little shit Aguero is, bottler.
####################
Have that city... Aguero dirty dirty cunt... Well played Chelsea
####################
Hazard is truly the best player in the league , no matter which team you support there is no denying that #Hazard #BPL

I bet Diego costa is heartbroken he was on the bench. He'd have been active on the beef

Absolute disgusting from @aguerosergiokun and Fernandinho - hopefully extra bans = 5 games each #MCICHE

Little scuffle after a ridiculous challenge from Aguero. Get in. Made even better by G Nev saying it's good to see.

#fpl
####################
@oddschecker To afford Aguero After served suspension would need rest of team to be very cheap (struggle with bargains)
####################
HAZARD!!
####################
Aguero actually tried to end Luiz's career there and yet he gets painted as a saint by pundits. Bastard.
####################
What is Aguero doing? Absolute nugget! However, Fabregas hit out first, so he should have gone with Fabregas. Heads gone.
####################
@BMRisingTV Haven't liked Bravo all season. We've sacrificed joe hart's goalkeeping abilities for passing and it has cost us again.

Aguero was naughty tho, from when you set off a riot
####################
2 straight red card for 2 unholy Mancity players in person of Aguero and Ronaldinho.
####################
Only Chelsea player who reacted was Chalobah and he was defending his teammates. Aguero and Fernandinho were just scumbags.
####################
Fernandinho has lost it
####################
A Cahill booking away from a 100/1 winner! Fucksake
####################
aguero should have done it earlier lol
####################
Awful from Aguero. Fabregas has to get in there and slither about doesn't he
####################
@Chelsea_HQ @SkySports There will be more on Fabregas/Fernan than that I guarantee it
####################
Class fron Fabregas.
####################
Agreed. If Costa acted like this there would be calls for a multi match ban. https://t.co/rhcotlJ61k
####################
small clubs like @ManCity will never grow up shame on them.. #coyb fabregas did no wrong was the gentleman in the scuffle in #MCICHE
####################
Fernandinho blood hot bustaiid! Was all that necessary? Zero
####################
I'd like to that keV De Bruyne for that miss
####################
Aguero trying it on Luiz again you dirty cunt.. lost respect for that guy now. #CFC
####################
Look at this game, 2 red cards, an own goal, City concede 3, Fernandinho being a sore loser. Damn, son.
####################
I pledge never to captain Aguero ever again in FL
####################
City just messed up the game. Disgusting behavior from Auguero and Fernandinho
####################
Fabregas had a good game overall. Shame about the provocation at the end.
####################
Fucking well done Aguero beautiful challenge
####################
Diego Costa, what a player.
####################
What a classic end to the game. City lose plus Fernandinho and Aguero three game bans. Decent day for them.
####################
@SyafilYsf like sedap only aguero give hahahaha
####################
Couldn't care less that Aguero is my captain the shithosue
####################
Ugly scenes at the Etihad at the end, Aguero that dirty fucker with a nasty challenge on Luiz shouldn't have done that
####################
@ManCity HAHA FUCKING TINPOT SHITCLUB HOPE AGUERO GETS HIT BY A TRUCK
####################
Didnt even see fernandinho get sent off tbh
####################
95th min, 3-1 down, pointless/horrible tackle from Aguero.. he needs fining a few months wage for that
####################
@jonnysmiffy @ESPNFC far dirtier than Costa!
####################
NO OTAMENDI, NO KUNT AGUERO AND NO FERNANDIN HOE IN NEXT FIXTURES FOR CITY.
SERVES THEM RIGHT.
####################
I can't relate to anything better than this https://t.co/EyADpxYYdy
####################
@CloakOfVader Fabregas gets some credit as well, just let Fernandinho go at him to goad him into that red, twats
####################
@jacckeh @GNev2 Naah I just saw fernandinho on fabregas, wtf haha
####################
...I'm lost on how many games Aguero is banned for over a challenge on DAVID LUIZ.  Need to know info for PL fantasy, that's all
####################
Big ban for Fernandinho, outrageous
####################
Bravo babou nos 3 gols
####################
Ah why wasn't Costa was on the pitch
####################
Aguero with that absolutely filthy challenge
####################
Imagine the scenes if costa would have done that
####################
Cahill cost us our clean sheet...
####################
I swear if kunt aguero doesn't get banned for more than 3 games..
####################
What a win. Diego Costa is a babe. #CFC
####################
Well that escalated quickly... Red cards to Fernando and Aguero... #manche
####################
City desperately poor defensively. How little trust must Pep have in Stones to take him off before Kolarov and Otamendi?
####################
Beautiful from Chelsea, disgusting from Man City. Aguero should be suspended 5 games for that shit challenge.
####################
Fernandinho putting himself about
####################
Costa has been better. https://t.co/1gNNoZ2ESq
####################
Filthy by Aguero. I'm no Costa fan but if he does that he'd be crucified. City capitulated. Fernandinho stupid. Cesc self control impressive
####################
Imagine if De Bruyne didn't miss open goals
####################
@BennieTheBaller costa's track record is all I need to say. Every person knows he's the biggest cunt in the prem league
####################
@FPLHints have hazard though... No cover for spurs hmm
####################
@CraigxMitch Aguero and fernaninho out of the arsenal game
####################
@_agyemang_ Fabregas slapped him first and acted calm once the ref was looking
####################
@bateson87 and aguero gets in form card this week !For what?Scored to lucky goals and in that game had a chances and blew it hahahahahhahah
####################
Yea you're not allowed to grab another player's throat multiple times https://t.co/XEeYOVA3o7
####################
Can't work out wether Costa was unplayable or Demichelis was terrible. Maybe both.
####################
Fernandinho and aguero will miss Arsenal's game
####################
This Bravo though...
####################
Disgrace #cfc https://t.co/mtcH5MJ6xU

####################
That is disgusting from Aguero - just disgusting
####################
Fernandinho should jus travel to Brazil. Not sure he will play till January.
####################
@fernandinho Scumbag of the year
####################
fucking ZERO class from Sergio Aguero, Fernandinho and Man Shitty #RedCard #GTFO
####################
@tomcox_7 fabregas kept his head so well to be fair
####################
Indeed. All goals scored by chelsea player. Nvm cahill you did good
####################
This also means that Aguero and Fernandinho  both are out of the Arsenal game. Deserved.
####################
Errm please @Kelz_JTS which Aguero were you ranting bout
####################
Absolute filth from Aguero &amp; Fernandinho... Shocking
####################
Bye Aguero its time to send you off my team too
####################
@tomroper87 in fairness, fabregas slapped him and then dived over the boards himself
####################
@CallumLydon170 Fernandinho well and truly lost his head
####################
If Costa got 3 games for accidentally stepping on snowflake Liverpool players what should Fernandinho get?  5 games?
####################
#Costa so good. Tough see him get injured. Hopefully not long out
####################
@jeffborzello I find it funny fabregas got a yellow card for getting choke slammed
####################
Aguero sent off,brilliant news
####################
#MCICHE Pep, welcome in the premier league, where you must be capable of losing with dignity as well #pep #aguero #fernandinho #toughestPL

If that was Luiz on Aguero he'd still be rolling round on the floor
####################
Thuggish behaviour by both Aguero and Fernandinho. This is not Libertadores dimwits. #cityvcfc
####################
In a bit aguero, cunt
####################
@Chelsea_HQ @SkySports no. Its not Costa.
####################
@premierleague i aguero doesn't get at least 5 match ban, If it were Suarez or Costa would have been 10 match bans, so shameful
####################
And aguero should get a 10 game ban for that challenge
####################
Obviously aguero would miss the Arsenal game....
####################
Quality game. Absolutely disgusting challenge from Aguero, career ender. Should be banned for the season
####################
If costa made that challenge there would be calls for him to be deported.....
####################
If the ref had sent off Luis in first half Aguero would not have kicked the cunt! Very poor referee! Very poor referee!
####################
@pilly1986 very lucky! Shame it ended in chaos!! Negative fantasy points for aguero and a suspension now
####################
@fernandinho bald prick
####################
BAN DIEGO COSTA FOR ALL THAT ! #MCICHE
####################
@TrueGeordieNUFC so silly from Aguero
####################
That was a disgrace btw from Fernandinho and Aguero.
####################
Costa is the best striker in prem lmaoo I always call these things
####################
That little scrap at the end between Fabregas n Fernandinho was more entertaining than Paquaio and Mayweather
####################
Fernandinho and Aguero are disgusting poor losers. COME ON CHELSEA!! Top of the league baby!!!
####################
Brazilians. Terrible individuals https://t.co/eJ0bzslwHL

@Michael_Sawyer Kante is the key figure, weirdly enough
####################
Horrible tackle by Aguero.
####################
Chelsea City involved in post game brawl after Aguero pays back Luiz with ankle stomp, two legged tackle. Suspension to follow

@ArsenalTerje Could we get a video of @cesc4official being humbled by @fernandinho please?
####################
@chrismd10  have you seen anything more Sunday league than that aguero tackle and the last couple of minutes of that game...

####################
What a prize tit Fernandinho is #MCICHE
####################
that dirty fuck deserves a 10 match ban https://t.co/5cU8tCgS2c
####################
Imagine if Costa was on the pitch during that scrap.
####################
Aguero out red card !!!!
####################
Since Rustu left Barcelona, we've not gotten a fantastic goal keeper till date. Bravo wasn't even close
####################
Fabregas looked like he wanted to cry. He's so like that. He'll do something on the sly and then do fuck all but shit it when he gets it
####################
@FootballFunnys shame on aguero!
####################
What a weekend for Aguero to be captain of my fantasy team and Fernandinho also on there #minuspoints
####################
Fabregas slapping Fernandinho and not reacting when he realizes cameras on him
####################
@YourMCFC fabregas slaps Fernandinho but sky brushed over it
####################
Lost the game when De Bruyne hit the cross bar 3 yards out
####################
Aguero's tackle was disgusting
####################
Fabregas how did you turn into  into such a classless person?
####################
Aguero mocked Cahill for the own goal. Then went in just to injure Luiz. Yet Costa is the scumbag
####################
Bound to happen with Taylor's officiating. Not excusing aguero but that was bound to happen
####################
Aguero &amp; Fernandinho to miss the Arsenal game. Early Christmas present for our folks.
####################
Gary Cahill was just trying to prove that Courtois too is a human! He can't maintain clean sheet in every single games! :D
####################
Fabregas patted Fernandinho in the face and then pretended like he's some victim. Lol. https://t.co/4RMPevuGem
####################
Hang your head Aguero, that was disgraceful.
####################
@UItraSuristic Pepe was banned for 8!! He should be banned for 8 atleast for that. Fabregas behaved like a girl there though haha
####################
Red card for Sergio Aguero &amp; Fernandinho. frustation getting the better of @Mancity. And on that violent note,the match ends 3-1 to Chelsea.
####################
"Aguero, it's over" https://t.co/yqEGEZXVPS

"@BabatundeCASH: They were lucky Costa was off when the fight broke out. Baba would have killed someone literally."
####################
Was that Aguero or Costa with the red card and general loss of mind? #askingforafriend #CFC #mufc
####################
Aguero and Fernandinho deserves 3 match ban each
####################
@mikewhitesport Fabregas responded superbly to Fernandinho's aggression. Surprising, because he's a massive bell.
####################
Absolutely shocking assault by Aguero. Deserved red card.
####################
Absolutely disastrous moment. Fernandinho and Aguero, City's two best players, to miss Leicester, Watford, and Arsenal
####################
if aguero was some english CB he'd be banned for a LONG time after this. same w fernandinho. @FA
####################
Fernandinho off as well?! Mad.
####################
Happy Happy Happy https://t.co/wdUCVWpFaT
####################
Fernandinho should be banned for the rest of the season
####################
Fernandinho couldn't take his L in peace, should be punished by the FA
####################
Aguero you beauty @fish_lfc8
####################
@NeathJack1 it was appalling!! Fernandinho may also be hot water too!
####################
Aguero should be banned for at least 5 games. that was thuggish
####################
Arsenal are going to beat city looool, no aguero and Fernandinho
####################
Fabregas has really kept his cool there.
####################
@MsBelleNiki So fucking annoying. Thank god he wasn't my captain. Costa and Hazard make up for him tho
####################
Get in Chelsea! 3 points and Aguero &amp; Fernandinho banned for a while :) #CFC

Fernandinho was like "HOW CAN HE CLAP?!"
####################
glad none a dem aint on my fantasy ,I would be flying way to double back aguero myself
####################
Advertising boards https://t.co/UrfkVNt7ub
####################
Aguero, perhaps feeling guilty, took out DavidLuiz with a poor challenge. Unnecessary for Fernandinho to pick on Fabregas. Both deserved Red
####################
Prefect tweet https://t.co/7WDp7j5qUS
####################
Not pretty scenes out there. Tackle from Aguero born out of frustration and all hell breaks lose. Tiny blemish to a fantastic game!
####################
Fucking Aguero costing me pale fpl
####################
City 1-3 Chelsea,top of the table,4 points difference against city,top scorer Costa gujjar,poor attitude by city players,well played blues&lt;3

####################
Thank goodness Costa was not on the pitch when that madness happened
####################
Aguero and Fernandinho absolute disgraceful. Fernandinho should get at least 10 game ban for his behaviour on Fabregas @SkyFootball
####################
@Simon_Breeze ahha no aguero huge boost for Arsenal
####################
Disgrace from aguero that, should be banned for more than 3 games
####################
Aguero sent off for a horrible tackle but Fernandinhio deserves a 10 match ban for putting his hand on Fareham throat and pushing him over
####################
Naughty from aguero that
####################
will aguero and fernandinho miss the liverpool game?!?!
####################
If didn't know Fernandinho is from the favelas! He went nuts!!!! #MCFC #cityofgod

@kksars12 @betway @cathalmur I'd still rather AV aguero long term but costa form player at moment no doubt
####################
no fucking way did aguero and did fernandinho deserve to get sent off
####################
Absolutely superb tackle from Aguero
####################
Chelsea had the best squad on paper at the start of the season. Fitting that they're top. Improved with Conte and Kante.
####################
Aguero deserves more than just his 3 game ban for that tackle. Vindictive, reckless and potentially career ending.
####################
Costa, Pedro and Luiz will be fine. Probably be back within a week or two
####################
Diego Costa best Striker in England
####################
So many people thought Costa was finished. I hoped he was. Nowhere fucking near it. What a player.
####################
@K11_TheDude it's how pep wants to play bravo will never be a great keeper in terms of saving imo it's his feet that's why he's there
####################
Disgusting from Aguero n Fernandinho. Also from Pep! Lets see if the FA handle them like they would with #mufc players. Fair play Chalobah
####################
Commendable by Cescy for not reacting to that wastman Fernandinho
####################
@ManCity aguero's attitude is bad... How poor is costa #sarkasm
####################
@Reyabii  hazard gave u a bonus I dream 2 but an additional of 1 came without dream
####################
Cesc played Ferandinho, gave him a lil slap on his face and then backed off till fernandinho lost it.
####################
Aguero It's time to leave my FPL shit. Utter disgrace.
####################
Not only did we beat them we got Aguero and Fernandinho suspended loooooool
####################
So unprofessional by Fernandinho, his own player cuts luiz in half and he goes insane. Pep should fine him like a months wages. Disgraceful
####################
True master of the Dark Arts. https://t.co/5rBVfuaXM8
####################
Very disappointing behaviour from Fernandinho. Pep shouldn't allow such shenanigans, but never quite bothered with it.
####################
Aguero why never break David Luiz legs
####################
Dear Jim Beglin, sure you didn't see Cesc attacking Fernandiho first. Say what you see, Cesc acted for the camera #Chelsea  #Fabregas
####################
Without aguero City could be out of top4 by january

#MCFC #CFC #LFC
####################
Kinda gutted it didn't kick off with Fabregas and the fans.
####################
Steaight red cards for Aguero and Fernandinho and miss the match against Arsenal.
How do you guys get so lucky @Arsenal ?
####################
Why did Fabregas slap a grown man like Fernandinho? Was he expecting Dinho to smile and hug him? I expect a Fabregas ban, too.
####################
#RMA: Keylor Navas starts in goal. Sergio Ramos is back in the starting eleven. The rest of the starting eleven remians unchanged. #SNs90
####################
Aguero with -3 points what the fuck
####################

It's Fernandinho that made a tit of himself.
####################
@premierleague first time i liked Aguero on city shirt.Based on shit refreeing on utd games.
####################
On the bright side, that's Aguero and Fernandinho out of the City v Arsenal game in two weeks.
####################
Thank you @chalobah for decking Aguero. Came on, set up 3rd goal and sent off two City players.
####################
@Joe96__ Aguero with an unreal foul on Luiz and it kicked off
####################
City losing the plot! Aguero finally gets his red card for a foul on David Luiz! Should have had one for a similar foul couple of yrs ago

Thank God,  I don't own Aguero #FPL

If i saw this sooner i would of cussed u differently https://t.co/TEzkSVKBr1
####################
Aguero is such a cunt
####################
@registability why Fernandinho had to act like that? Frustration at it's max
####################
Man City lost that game for 2 reasons.

1. Didn't take their chances
2. Poor Goalkeeper. Bravo is a downgrade on Hart
####################
What a fucking tackle Aguero. He wants a break over Christmas, have to respect that.
####################
@RKU79 Fabregas so smart in that situation, could've got a card but kept his cool. Not a fan of his but that's how you should act there

When they win Aguero is the star, when they lose he's the dirty player.. The difference with Messi &amp; C.Ronaldo is clear!
####################
Hahahaha city have been so rustled it's unreal, aguero acting like the modern day Duncan Ferguson
####################
Is Aguero out for 1 game or 3

Diego is a world class monster. Aguero needs a 5 match ban

Those two counter attack goals were the bestest goals this season created outa nothing Hazard and Willian amazing runners with the Ball

Costa is a different player this season. Chelsea looking very dangerous
####################
Bravo is a joke

Fabregas showed a really strong character to the savagery of Fernandinho #MCICHE

If costa was on the pitch. Fernandinho would have gotten handled on a next one.

Aguero ruining my transfers plan!
####################
Up The Blues #MNCCHE,  what an unSporting Behavior by Kun &amp; Fernandinho @kalyangoR
####################
Aguero and especially Fernandinho have badly let City down. Game was lost, frustration boiled over and both will serve needless 3 game bans.
####################
3 match ban isn't enough for Aguero
####################
When your captain is Aguero https://t.co/pXorylv60f

So who has Aguero as their FPL captain then?
####################
Aguero should receive 4 matches for his foolishness

Awful from aguero
####################
Good work from the ref. Correct 2 players sent off. Aguero for the challenge, Fernandinho for bullying #MCYvCHE
####################
@BossBayo fabregas a bitch
####################
Always good to remember when Aguero wasn't sent off in an awful hit on David Luiz. Today, sent off properly
####################
Fernandinho what a RAT!
####################
A poor challenge from Sergio Aguero. He's been sent off... in the 97th minute! 

#MCICHE https://t.co/TdfZKTZsvc

That Aguero challenge on David Luiz was shocking #MCICHE https://t.co/shyXOEBB0B
####################
What's going on here !! Aguero !! Shocking tackle, Fernandinho too !! 2 red cards WTF only 2 reds lol
####################
The most shocking part of that whole brawl was Costa stayed relatively calm and composed. He's the ultimate troll
####################
And then Fabregas with the slap, Mourinho gets sent to the stands for a bottle kick and Fabregas won't be charged as seriously for a slap
####################
@YourMCFC not with bravo in net
####################
Sergio Aguero has proved to be a complete idiot. And will suffer terribly for his offence #CFC #mcfc
####################
No defending that. I love Aguero but that's absolutely disgusting.
####################
LMAO; so who out here captained Aguero ?

That was a fantastic game to watch, great scenes. Aguero and Fernandinho out of the Arsenal match is such a bonus #MCICHE

Luiz deserved it, @fernandinho YOU ARE A LEGEND!
####################
@Armaan_Singh18 @ManCity if you look, fernandinho only gets vexed coz fabregas slaps him
####################
@Kloppholic no mate, fabregas actually slapped fernandinho first on the face for him to react like that.

Wonder if anybody has found Fernandinho's head yet
####################
I liked a @YouTube video from @evilsimonn https://t.co/2Vfyvg0w0Z Fernandinho vs Fabregas!! FIGHT!!

####################
Perhaps Pep &amp; men can't control themselves after all! Similar incidents against w/Mourinho in #elclasico! Disgusting from Aguero! #MCICHE
####################
Fucking muppet Fernandinho there, embarrassing end
####################
Fabregas is one of the best low key scumbags in football history.
####################
That aguero tackle is an absolute shocker and Fernandinho shouldn't see a football pitch for a long time for that reaction

*smart af, no pussy. https://t.co/UdnAGV4Mdd
####################
Same Fernandinho who Messi called an "Imbecile" and Fernadinho was waiting to brush him in the tunnel
####################
Wow. Fabregas stayed calm. After the 3rd choke by Fernandhino I would have dropped him.
####################
Costa is an amazing striker no doubt, but i swear the cheating cunt deserves a career red card
####################
@PhillTheBull that aguero 'tackle' was horrendous. And yeah grabbed him by throats at least 3 times then shoved him over boards
####################
Thank you Chelsea! No Aguero against Arsenal hahahahaha
####################
Wtf is aguero doing.. if that was costa or anyone dirty mans will be in bits..
####################
Aguero fouled Luiz prompting the whole drama. Fernadinho for going for Fabregas throat repeatedly
####################
Absolutely not a single reason for Fernandinho to keep pushing Cesc like that!
####################
Imagine Costa done that tackle. You'd never hear the end of it
####################
Aguero and Fernandino in UFC next year, you heard it first
####################
What a fucking dummy https://t.co/ao8jyTU5az
####################
@alexgenniss couldn't agree more, shock. Cahill and Alonso out, Rugani and De Sciglio in.
####################
@nekkie_u You do realize he slapped Fernandinho first
####################
On another note that challenge by Aguero was awful, knew exactly what he was doing.
####################
Will there be a segment in the analysis called Aguero Crimes? #cfc #chelsea
####################
Lmao dumbass aguero literally jumped on luiz
####################
The people who captained Aguero must be fuming #FPL #MCICHE
####################
De bruyne done us a solid for discovering him
####################
None at all. Aguero lost the plot because they'd lost the game, nothing to do with anything else. https://t.co/H4gmzXVuiI
####################
Aguero should get 5 minimum for that imo

What is Aguero's problem with David Luiz, everytime they meet there's always an issue with tackles etc
####################
Aguero has some daddy issues with Luiz. 3 years ago same tackle in FA cup final. No card then #bbcfootball
####################
Aguero should be banned for 10 games for that the cunt

Aguero deserves an 8 match ban for that, stupid little cunt
####################
@Rope___ @Rope___ that Hazard goal was like slapping them in the face with the clobber *my bad wrong acct at first
####################
So I didn't captain #Aguero last week and regretted it, wasn't making that mistake again and he now gets a red card! #FPL
####################
suppose Costa was on the pitch? One of thoae cards would have had to been his. Chalobah took it for him I guess lol
####################
@RafaelH117 The City players are cunts. Aguero, Fernandinho, Iheanacho. Cunts.
####################
Fernandinho.. what a guy

That was a shocking tackle from Aguero and hope Fernandinho gets a longer ban no need for what he did to Fabregas #MCICHE

Should be more than a 3 match ban for aguero

Aguero won the ball? Don't know what everyone is on about
####################
We ain't ever letting go of top spot no matter how many times Cahill screws up !! Zouma's around the corner to take him out too. #MCICHE

Fernandinho will also get banned but I want him to play

Fair play to Fabregas for not reacting to that too. Was shoved back into City fans as well. Acted how a role model should.
####################
@HassanSafa more pissed at Fernandinho
####################
Fabregas was very MATURE there ....
####################
Should be a 5+ game ban for Aguero, vile tackle

3 matches or more for Aguero and Fernandinho as well. Miss Arsenal game so it'll be even more banter when we lose.

Ooooo SERGIO and a Fabregas slap on Dinho gettin chippy
####################
Fernandinho pushing Fabregas in the crowd shame there was no one there
####################
Ok I expect aguero to get a ban longer than 7 games. Because that was way worse than kicking a bottle. Also I expect an 18k+ fine.
####################
Pathetic behaviour from fabregas how he snaked Fernandinho to get a red card ! Augero deserve to get a red card ! #cityvcfc
####################
Shit manager, nothing club, league gone, Aguero and Fernandinho 3 match bans hahahaha. Fucking inbred city cunts. What an embarrassment.

Fabregas what a game. Saw very little of the ball, but three times he found space, created 2 glorious chances, taken by Costa.
####################
Sergio Aguero is a dirty scummy bastard
####################
Fair play Chelsea, Hazard and Costa are on another level
####################
@anaIdirgeprat provoked fernandinho then acted the victim.

Aguero red carded. My Fantasy is completely ruined. I should retire from Fantasy now.
####################
@bozzatrfc I love Aguero but that was shocking he actually went for his knee
####################
It wasn't a tackle from Aguero, though. He lost the ball, so he just took Luiz out.
####################
The only that seperates aguero being a world class striker to me is that he always misses half of every season with injury/suspension
####################
There's something about Aguero that I really don't like. Have this feeling for a long time.
####################
Aguero and Fernandino  to miss Arsenal game! Not bad

What kind of tackle was that...

Gotta love Fabregas. Biggest wind up merchant in the league. Loves getting people in trouble.

That will be a Minimum 4-game ban for Aguero due to previous ban. Back for Liverpool on 31st December. Could get longer as was violent.
####################
have to be honest, i lost a little respect for aguero right there.

@richardajkeys Cracking game to watch Keysie, despite Aguero's appalling challenge.  Deserves more than a three game ban!
####################
Luiz could've gotten a red card for a foul on Aguero. Then Luiz later stepped on his ankle. So its clear frustration from Aguero. Awful foul
####################
I don't know what happened that caused a fight. Aguero's tackle was absolutely treacherous. Deserved a dlred card, so why did Cit retaliate?
####################
The tackle from Aguero reminded me off all the tackles when Liverpool John Moores played against Liverpool Uni. God I loved those games!!
####################
Diego Costa. Divine Emperor and Lord Supreme of the proud Monchichi people. https://t.co/z7E6TRq9Qj
####################
@Empyre_Stocka Fernandinho was like grabbing Fabre gas by the neck and fabregas was just like whatever cunt go ahead

####################
Hazard and Costa are my fantasy team #WhoNeedsAguero
####################
No Aguero, Fernandinho or Otamendi for city next week, their best striker, midfielder and defender (if you can call Otamendi a defender)
####################
Triple Captained Aguero and he goes and gets a red. Lovely
####################
Well that was a fun match! Surely a big ban for Aguero. Absolutely shocking challenge. #MCICHE
####################
Aguero Lost his head 
Chelsea Players got on to him
Inheacho back his team mate 
Fab threw cheeky slap 
Nadinho handled him
####################
@BBCSport  Fernandinho was disgraceful as well..worth a good few games out?
####################
Terrible challenge from #Aguero - that should be more than a 3 game ban.
####################
Aguero was my captain...
####################
It went completely off the boil at the end there. Fernandinho lost his head.
####################
Shame @fernandinho didnt knock fabregas out considering he got sent off anyway
####################
Fuck off Aguero, Pep and all of man city!! #Wearetopoftheleague
####################
Tbh I thought Aguero got the ball
####################
Fabregas was bigger pussy than me when Danny De Carvalho offered me out.
####################
@OptaJoe Any stats on how many games Aguero has sat out against @Arsenal ? Maybe he's a secret Gooner! :)
####################
Aguero should actually get nicked for that tackle
####################
Yaya Toure to start playing regular football courtesy Fernandinho red... On the brighter side
####################
I'm gonna ignore my C getting sent off and enjoy Costa 9 points and Alonso assist! Stupid Sergio! Bye bye
####################
Aguero and fernandinho out of the arsenal game
####################
#ManCityvsChelsea hard loss for man city. To add insult to injury got 2 red cards at the end aguerro and Fernandinho.
####################
Sergio Aguero is a nasty wee prick, what a fucking baby
####################
@bateson87 fabregas defo slapped him - just got replayed on danish tv

####################
Tell Fernandinho to take a chill pill the dirty Fucker @ManCity
####################
Fabregas will get a red later when video is reviewed. He instigated that. @BBCSport
####################
Can't work out wether Costa was unplayable or Otamendi was terrible. Maybe both.
####################
5 match ban for Aguero. 10 match touchline ban for Pep.
####################
Chelsea will win the league

Lack of injuries
Balanced XI that works for each other
Impact subs ie Fabregas &amp; Willian
####################
Fernandinho shoulda just make mate swallow his Adams apple
####################
@DTDmatt @TiernanWalker violent conduct and it wasn't Costa who would have thought
####################
Typically sly face slap from #Fabregas on Fernandinho there #MCFCvCFC &amp; wonderful innocent face as chaos ensued
####################
Funny how Chalobah nails Aguero in front of the ref and nothing doing. One sided refereeing all game.
####################
Aguero has always been getting away with that for years... he stamped on Luiz a couple of years back
####################
I think Aguero has been unlucky to be sent off there, I thought he got the balls.
####################
@MrTuktoyaktuk for all of Joe Hart's mistakes, he's a better keeper for this version of MCFC than Bravo is, IMO. Woulda kept him longer
####################
Did you see what aguero did?unforgivable https://t.co/HZcRD8wyKn
####################
Dinho and Aguero have easily copped 3 game bans there, each.
####################
Fabregas gave cheeky slap. Iheanacho feeling like a Nigerian father..
####################
@Okwonga had a little slap at Fernandinho which the commentators missed.
####################
Taken Aguero out of my team. No time.
####################
That was appalling https://t.co/d2gyY8aESW
####################
@ashe666 awful. fernandinho was a little shit too.
####################
City's behaviour is absolutely disgusting. Fernandinho should be banned for 6 matches minimum

####################
@Chelsea_HQ @SkySports no. He's not Costa.
####################
Fernandinho just got to live a long-term dream of mine.
####################
Wow. I applaud Chelsea for their calm. Shocking tackle by Aguero, Costa acting as peacemaker, &amp; Fabregas refusing to react #bbcfootball
####################
@JakeWoodsC8 that Aguero tackle at the end possibly the worst I've seen. Look at his face when he goes into Luiz. Meant every bit of it
####################
Absolutely embarrassing Man City. Aguero a fucking joke tackle, should throw the book at him.
####################
Aguero should get more than 3 games for that surely!?
####################
Well done @ChelseaFC !!! Big win away against another title contender...#conte #costa #hazard
####################
3 match ban for Aguero for sure. Not even in question #FPL

@SportsSturm Chelsea seems to bring out the worst in whomever they play.  Aguero will be gone for 4 weeks.  Fernandinho prob out too.
####################
So captaining Aguero backfired spectacularly #MCFCvCFC #FantasyFootball
####################
@ManCity money can't by you class, but it has got u a overrated manager. Acting like kids cos u lost!! You got outplayed!! Costa bossed it!
####################
@jimbeglin and @PeterDrury I think you guys missed when Fabregas slapped Fernandinho for that reaction #MCFCvCFC @cesc4official disgraceful
####################
@Fa you better do something about that slap form febragas too!!! Not only Fernandinho
####################
Otamendi is a terrible defender. Worse than Rojo. Romero is a better goalie than Bravo. #mufc
####################
Fabregas was quality today
####################
Just seen Diego Costa's goal. What a pass from Fabregas, what a finish.
####################
Since I'm pretty, pretty boys don't like to fight. I saw Manchester City's Fernandinho trying to fight with Fabregras.just bcoz they lost...
####################
chelsea is the king of come backs. great performance by costa, willian and my fvt hazard #MCICHE
####################
Cahill even gave em a goal hahahaha. Where was aguero????

Posted by: TheSunFootball #Football RED CARD! Aguero sent off for a horror tackle on David Luiz https://t.co/vWF1rercgI
####################
We scored 4 goals in alll... Cahill, Costa, willians, hazard
####################
Aguero deserves a lot longer than three games for that tackle, disgusting.
####################
@TheFalseNein yep. Remember Aguero  was dropped against Barcelona. Guardiola not his biggest fan.
####################
Aguero &amp; Fernandinho absolutely lost their heads there. Big bans ahead for both. #MCICHE #MCFC
####################
Why is @DeBruyneKev crying? #Guardiola said #Debruyne is d best in #EPL. I guess he never met #Hazard until 2day. #city best is 4 our bench

@shannon_ae this would've been a whole different game if de Bruyne didn't turn into Stephen Hawking in front of goal
####################
And Fabregas with the slap as well?! No red? Seems legit. #ChelseaBias
####################
@_VeeChi before Fernandinho had started pushing him, cesc was grabbing him by the back of the neck when he was checking on Luiz

####################
Could be a big ban for Fernandinho and Aguero could be 4 matches. #ManCity
####################
Am I misremembering or did Aguero stamp on Luiz a few seasons back as well? Think the ref missed it
####################
I'm driving. WTF just happened with #MCICHE ?! 2 reds for Sergio &amp; Fernandinho in the last moments?
####################
Have to say Fernandinho grabs my throat once twice 3 three times! #THINKBIKE right hook lights out hahaha

Nice game,  so much indiscipline from city at the end though .  2 red cards; Aguero &amp; fernandinho @ 90'+5'

Fernandinho , Aguero out during the Arsenal game  3 match ban
####################
How Fabregas kept his cool was insane, knew exactly what he was doing.
####################
Chelseas man of the match anthony taylor hes a joke and full respect for aguero for taking out david shaggy luiz
####################
Idk how Fabregas kept his cool there boy
####################
Man C 1 Che 3 
Brutal challenge on Luiz by Aguero sees him sent off along with Fernandinho who lost the plot.Chelsea or Liverpool for me now
####################
Aguero has form against Luiz... https://t.co/oDuZyMGf6T
####################
@bensmith130 he got him started.. then he kept grabbing him but Fabregas had a go first!
####################
Kun and Fernandinho need more discipline. That was unnecessary #MCICHE
####################
Aguero missed our game, doesn't he? 3 match ban, we are the third match.
####################
Fernandinho deserves retrospective action for that, pretty much assaulted Fabregas #MCICHE
####################
Aguero's the sort of bloke who'd give the bouncer a shove from behind when it kicks off outside a club.
####################
Man, how did he remain so cool there? https://t.co/cNZjVIV9xR
####################
@MaitreSean @MrGeorgeBenson @GaryLineker You might need to change the picture from Fernando to Aguero, mate.

@CFC__FAN fernandinho though, fabregas was just taking it, pussy!

Whole team https://t.co/mR0kUdc2LB
####################

####################
@RobJohn0 very happy mate got a bit tasty at the end :) aguero lost his head
####################
aguero should get a knighthood for routinely trying to break david luiz's legs
####################
Fucking love Fernandinho
####################
@RobbieSavage8 yea bt its aguero he's so tiny
####################
Thank God sey Costa no dey pitch during the fight

####################
Despite the result it was a very good game. If only De bruyne would've scored that shotl he missed.
####################
Aguero with an awful tackle on David Luiz. Deserves a few game suspension with that one. Disgrace
####################
Fernandinho is going away for a long time..
####################
@Kloppholic are u blind. Fabregas slapped him and started it all
####################
They laughed at me when I said Chelsea would win the league. Mocked me when I called Kante signing of the season. Pagans. The lot of em.
####################
Fabregas instigated the fight by slapping Fernandinho first.
####################
Lol he ain't on smoke https://t.co/qLOJ2yepUa
####################
Fernandinho grabbed Cesc by the throat 4 times before pushing him over the sideboard. If that doesn't warrant a lengthy ban idk what does.
####################
He was a good boy. https://t.co/5AgbaL4lkX
####################
@lwpitcher tbf Fabregas gave him a cheeky slap amd then played Mr Innocent
####################
Fuck @ManCity, Fuck Sergio Aguero and fuck Fernandinho. Pieces of shit

Fernandinho is a disgrace
####################
Absolutely disgusting tackle that by aguero wouldn't be surprised if it's more than 3 games
####################
Fabregas slapped him and set him up for a glaring red card.
####################
Otamendi out next week thankfully, sadly Fernandinho &amp; Aguero too.
####################
Fabregas was brilliant there..he played Fernandinho into doing that....hahaha !!! #MCICHE
####################
We are definitely sure Fernandinho is gonna be gone for more than just 2 games. #MCICHE

Fernandinho also sent off for a run-in with Fabregas. #cityvcfc

How many games do you think Fernandinho will be suspended for? That was awful from him in the end..
####################
Come on journalists are you going to rip Aguero to pieces like you would if it was Costa????

Disgusting play from Fernandinho and Aguero. Can't understand why that had to happen. Lost any respect I had for either player.

Eden Hazard, the real cotta of the #10
####################
@fernandinho you're a fucking pussy you scrawny prick
####################
Such a good game of football. My favourite moment was fabregas being bullied.
####################
@PrometheusX1Z @ThisIsRowly Quite so. City have just lost Aguero and Fenandinho for 3 games each. It can change very quickly.
####################
I'm thankful for the 3 points and also for Costa not being on the pitch during that brawl.
####################
Fernandinho and Aguero lost their head. Pep lost his hair.

I wonder what Cesc said to Fernandinho he wasnt going off for no reason #MCICHE
####################
Awful from Fernandinho. Had no reason whatsoever to have a go at Fabregas. Should have an extended ban hopefully.

@siclancy Fabregas has always been a little shithouse though - wonder whether he'll get done retrospectively?

That was pish poor from Aguero there.. the game was done and hes just made things even harder for City now..

That Chelsea team is scary good
Hazard is miles ahead of anyone in that league

Massive pussy Fabregas is man couldn't even look Fernandinho in the eye

Slightly amusing how Cesc basically dived into the crowd to make sure Fernandinho got a red. He wasn't shoved in.
####################
Suspension for Fabregas too surely #MCICHE
####################
Aguero and Fernandinho missing the Arsenal game is welcome development. Hope we have enough to beat them
####################
Tbf to aguero, you get a chance to cut David Luiz in half, you're taking it

Very undignified end from City there. Shocking challenge, awful follow up from Fernandinho. Another title blown by City by December.

That should be a 6 match ban for #aguero #shocker

Diego Costa and Hazard are fabulous individuals. The more pragmatic and cynical style keeps on winning. #MCICHE
####################
I don't understand how Pep rates Bravo ahead of Joe Hart
####################
Eventually Aguero loses it and rightly gets sent off for bad tackle.

What a horrendous tackle from Aguero the dirty bastard. What a cracking game though!

Yeah he will get a extension on that. Could have snapped Luiz's leg https://t.co/rMFmFWpZ3e
####################
Diego Costa is really our best player.
####################
@SportsCenter Hazard
####################
Aguero is great and all, but he's got a dirty mean streak. Really flies under the radar.
####################
Aguero wow!! Shades of @steffandavies9 #forwardstackle #snap #wrap
####################
So Aguero gets a red card but will return just in time to face us. Brilliant that!!
####################
Fabregas is some cheat
####################
If the Aguero challenge was Fellaini then there would be calls for a 6 game ban and making a proper example of him. Shocker!
####################
@StuBrennanMEN fabregas slapped him , then watch fabregas looking where the hoarding is then "falling" over it
####################
Imagne the hate if Costa got sent off for that tackle
####################
Fernandinho is a dickhead
####################
Chillll https://t.co/3wG4b3muI8
####################
Diego Costa would have LOVED to be involved in that mayhem at the end. A goal &amp; assist will have to do #MCICHE #CFC
####################
Every rule broken by Aguero with that lunge. Ban the man for 8 games. Crazy.
####################
Ridiculous match. Ref was appalling. Pep made some bad decisions. City lost their heads and Aguero and Fernandinho to miss next 3 games!
####################
but but fernandinho &gt; pogba
####################
LOVE IT!!! LUIZ IS A PILE OF SHIT!!! https://t.co/El1c4o9Mfv
####################
A poor challenge from Sergio Aguero. He's been sent off... in the 97th minute! 

#MCICHE https://t.co/0slX6vKZ7Y

####################
@joe_weller_ yeah, but Fabregas can get away with a slap and u dont talk shit about that?
####################
Both Aguero and Fernandinho will be suspended for next weeks game against Arsenal. Lovely.
####################
This conte sides are really really good. No doubt. Pure class 3-4-3. Shame on aguero for that bad challenge.
####################
Got the scoreline right anyway https://t.co/apOEdfLXgC
####################
Why do I feel like cesc hit Fernandinho with some racist gist?...even as Chelsea fan me no support that one sha
####################
I still don't like Claudio bravo
####################
Disgusting by Man City. Sergio Aguero crimes
####################
Quality tackle from aguero
####################
And someone somewhere will rate claudio bravo ahead of joe hart
####################
Huge favourites for the title, Aguero showing his true colours today
####################
Bravo should've done better. Willian goal is too easy.
####################
Aguero is still miles better than Costa simmer down
####################
Disgusting challenge from Aguero
####################
Same!! https://t.co/GP0Glz4dZQ
####################
So Aguero and Fernandinho both miss the game against #Arsenal. Ha Ha Ha.............................. #bbcfootball #MCICHE
####################
What despicable play from Fernandinho. Aguaro, fair enough bad challenge But Fernandinho, get a grip lose with some dignity.
####################
Can't be too judgemental of Aguero I used to lash those tackles in every time we conceded back in the day
####################
Chelsea fan but disappointed about Aguero or Aguer's redcard becoz he is my captain in fantasy football league.
####################
3-1 like i predicted 
Costa scoring and hazard
Chelsea is unstoppable https://t.co/0Gu7CYNwvL
####################
Aguero's man city career ended today
####################
Aguero must really hate David Luiz. What a horrible challenge #EPL
####################
That was a leg breaker. Dirty Farkin Argie bastad. Deserved straight red. Fernandinho red too, shoved Cesc over hoarding. Great result.
####################
Not like Aguero hasn't done this before. https://t.co/m1lWZmfSBR
####################
City should be down to 8, Fernandinho should have gone (and he will retrospectively)
####################
FT : Manchester City 1-3 Chelsea
59' Diego Costa

####################
As much as I love Aguero you can't be throwing yourself into another player like that, silly, reckless, lost his head.
####################
That tackle was out of character from Aguero... https://t.co/jzdC9MBpbx
####################

####################
Somebody transfer Aguero come ein team this week Lol
####################
Diego Costa is absolutely world class.
####################

####################
@FootyAccums just needed a Cahill booking! https://t.co/2QWl1yt99A
####################
#cfc aguero is a dirty cunt he should be arrested for that tackle
####################
Disgusting behaviour from #ManCity players at the end there. Completely lost their heads. Imagine if Costa had still been on though! #MCICHE
####################
He will get more than three games https://t.co/OrXMbJMvGq

Claudio Bravo is Guardiola's biggest L
####################
Discipline is key https://t.co/ny92AgIbJK
####################
Bravo just couldnt care less.
####################
@TheoMilki81 He started it by slapping Fernandinho?
####################
Transferred Aguero out of my fantasy team one minute before the deadline this morning. Phenomenal piece of business! #FPL
####################
wish chalobah gave aguero a hook
####################
Aguero deserves a lengthy ban, no way that is acceptable, especially at that professional level #MCFC #CFC
####################
We didn't play well, we won 1-3 away at the favorites, and exposed Aguero for the fraud and scum he is
####################
@jag_bros lol after slapping Fernandinho first. See the replay.
####################
So basically I have Cahill scoring an own goal and Aguero getting a red for my fantasy team and its not even 3 yet.
####################
Costa 9 points Hazard 7 points ! I love my boyss
####################
I'm not a fan of Chelsea but truth be told Diego Costa is simply awesome! Every fan wish he could be their player!
####################
Fernandinho will still get match ban join. We know the game is intense but that's an animalistic behaviour.
####################

####################
What a performance from chelsea. Aguero is a disgusting cunt fernandinhno is a prick fuck me. Top of the league love it! #CFC

#CFCLive.  English FA must punish MCity gang. This is a disgrace to the beautiful game. Fernandino and Aguero disgusting culprits.

Lol City without Aguero and Fernandinho is gonna be fun
####################
Aguero just wanted to avoid end of match L. Got a red and ran away.
####################
Well done Chalobah. You cant watch someone do that to your team mate and stand by. What Fernandinho was upset about i'll never know
####################
Stunning mentality from Aguero
####################
@Arsenal owe us one. Got Aguero and Fernandinho suspended for their game.
####################
Smh manshitty https://t.co/x5LDRVuXks

"@MarkOgden_: Could be a four match ban for Aguero after already serving one violent conduct ban this season" hope its more
####################
If only Fernandinho was on that plane

Aguero should be ashamed of himself! Horrr tackle which could have really hurt Luiz! Fabregas played the whole Fernandinho thing beautifully
####################
Fabregas slapped him? Ban him too XD https://t.co/bD1yDYtJ40

####################
Should take our chances more! And bravo needs to fuck off

Thought Aguero went for the ball
####################
Fabregas would have killed Fernandinho but kept his head
####################
#MCICHE Aguero is bitch!!!!!

####################
Navas is the only player I can't criticize.
####################
Thank God Aguero and fernadinho will miss arsenal game .
####################
Lost all respect for Aguero and Fernandinho, absolutely disgusting
####################
Claudio Bravo be serious key
####################
@FPLViper I was worried about Costa being injured but he jumped off that bench pretty quick
####################
How the hell did we do that? Wow... Side note - Fernandinho's a wanker, isn't he?
####################
It is all drama ,both Aguero and Ferna' sent off as Chelsea makes Manchester City sing blues at Etihand.
####################
Aguero is just a wealthy cow, overrated!! scoring most against kak teams like him
####################
Fernandinho needs to be suspended the rest of the season, that's up their with some of the most disgusting behaviour the premiership has had
####################
Silva is the best player in that City team.
####################
Guardiola refuses to shake hand with all of Chelsea player especially fabregas #CHEMCI

fernandinho is conor mcgregor's wannabe #MCICHE
####################
Fabregas's wife and kids are going to watch that
####################
Having said that, it was pretty funny watching Fabregas be pushed over so maybe shouldn't have been a red
####################
De bruyne miss the goals and it cost them
####################
Aguero needs a long hard look at himself. Letting our team down in ridiculous fashion. Roll on gabriel jesus at this rate! #mcfc
####################
@BarstoolSam This Chelsea team has absurd mental toughness. It's night and day from last season, especially with Costa
####################
Fernandinho might get a 3 match ban for each time he choked Fabregas. That was crazy. #MCICHE
####################
Respect.  Huge respect to Fabregas for not punching that idiot Fernandinho in the face
####################
Cahill is lucky we won, he needs to stop making these silly mistakes https://t.co/AJf74Bj43p
####################
Aguero and fernandinho would have never tried that if Costa was on the pitch he would have battered both of em #ManCityvsChelsea
####################
@aed2464c33424f0 looked better on the attack hazard and Costa class
####################
Fingers crossed aguero gets more than 3 games and misses our game, truly shocking tackle that
####################
Red abysmal, bottled Luiz red card. Fallout. If I'm a City fan, I'm loving that from #Aguero. Shows he gives a fuck. But I'm a nasty prick.
####################
Pepe snubs fabregas' handshake. What a shame!!? #MCICHE @PremLeagueNews_

Shifting the 3-4-3 to a 5-4-1 and moving Hazard up top is a brilliant way to close out games. Glad that Conte is on our side. #CFC #KTBFFH

Fucking awful challenge from Aguero.

As bad as Costa is, he know his limits, Aguero don't. Costa &gt; aguero.

Fair play to Cesc for not getting involved when Fernandinho was squaring up to him!

So no Aguero or Fernandinho for Arsenal. Brilliant. Learn to accept the L and move on
####################
@GaryLineker you Kante ignore the evidence https://t.co/OL0RAgjQhw
####################
Sergio Aguero is absolutely filthy, surely will get at least a heavy ban for that tackle
####################
@alanshearer wat u think about aguero doing shitty things whenever he's losing. Sore loser
####################
good on ferna should have snapped fabregas' throat
####################
Chalobah putting Aguero in his place
####################
That was a discracefull challenge from aguero!!! Understandable that chalonah would react!!
####################
Just imagine Aguero did what Costa did. He'd get arrested.
####################
Disgusting from Aguero and Fernandinho, letting their side side. So disappointing
####################
As Aguero &amp; Fernandino got straight reds, they miss Arsenal Vs. City.
####################
Aguero deserves a few games ban after that disgusting challenge. Poor performance topped off with that.
####################
Aguero was destined for that kind of end. He is turning into a utterly ugly footballer. Imagine if Diego had done that. #MCICHE
####################
Wtf Fernandinho.... what an idiot
####################
Take Aguero out, not this Monday but the following Monday.  Then put him back in for the last 2 games of December?????  #sundreamteam
####################
So Fernandinho will be back for Arsenal? https://t.co/itcGGz2kEx
####################
@AdamJosephSport Fernandinho gone for grabbing Fabregas neck, not sure what incited it though
####################
Can't blame Fernandinho tbh if Fabregas was acting like that in front of me I'd have taken a swing at him
####################
Aguero and Fernandinho misses Leicester, Watford and Arsenal. Fuck the prem. just banter the rest of the season and win the CL
####################
If Aguero isn't suspended for the rest of the season I'm fucking rioting the cunt is a fucking scumbag and needs his chin tested
####################
@cjwalters66 Can't stand Fabregas but that was ridiculous reaction. Hopefully Aguero is banned for Arsenal game

Scenes at the end there with both Aguero and Fernandinho off!
####################
Fernandinho what a dick
####################
Fernandinho put the fear of God in Fabregas..
####################
Well, I didn't even see where it started I just saw Fernandinho grabbing Fabregas by the throat.
####################
Aguero low key as much of a hot head as Costa when it's not going his way imo.
####################
You'll hear nothing about;
Pep mocking the ref
Aguero needing a serious lengthy ban for a disgusting challenge 
Disgraceful behaviour.
####################
Also was choking the guy... Fernandinho should be banned for at least 3 games. https://t.co/VRT8cBmrMU

@90min_football Are you kidding? Fabregas clearly slapped him. We all saw that

How has Chalobah not been sent off? Shocking tackle from Aguero though

Disciplinary actions pending for Fernandinho for sure.

Aguero does not like Luiz does he?
####################
Fernandinho and Aguero 3 match bans. Imagine getting so rustled by one manager you resort to physical violence, pathetic club @ManCity
####################
@richardajkeys city lost heads but sly left hand slap by Fabregas to Fernandinho's face.
####################
@TrueGeordieNUFC Outclassed is a massive overstatement! De bruyne scores that open goal and we're definitely winning that game

I think all man city players except Silva lost their heads then

Imagine if Zlatan had Aguero's performance

Pogba had De Bruyne's

Bailly had Otamendi's

And Mourinho behaved like Pep on the touchline!
####################
@Lightest_Lighty it made no sense, guessing fabregas said something to him but still, no composure, he just wanted to be involved

He's only start 2 games bruh ! Ahahaha https://t.co/dgcalGL8qu
####################
Money on fabregas saying something about the plane crash to fernandinho?
####################
@MediaPuntaRSA What?! Calm head. Could've easily got involved but stayed calm and antagonised Fernandinho. No need to get involved.
####################
aguero's a fraud anyway, only scores against bottom half teams
####################
Wish Costa was still playing at the end. Fernandinho definitely wouldn't have gave it the big'un then.
####################
WE'RE THE BIGGER CLUB, What a second half was a huge improvement, And City didn't even score one goal, Fabregas.. PASS OF THE SEASON.
####################
@seisekitravis that tackle from Aguero was disgusting, glad they both got straight reds for it
####################
Aguero minus 2 points what a prick
####################
In all seriousness though, how good is Ngolo Kante
####################
@SkySports are we gonna be seeing commentary about the criminal Aguero? Just checking though!
####################
Fernandinho can catch this fade, don't give a damn if he's from the favellas

On the brighter side, Aguero out of Arsenals game

I'd rather have Boriello and Padoin, than player like Aguero and Fernandinho. Pathetic you piece of shit @ManCity #ManCityvsChelsea
####################
costa injured, aguero sent off, rip fantasy team
####################
Fernandinho you fucking rodent
####################
Fernandinho needs a long ban for that. Disgrace. #cfc #MCFCvCFC
####################
Diego Costa presently is without doubt the best attacker in world football.

You can take that to the bank.
####################
Frustrating Idiotic Epic Lucky fucking piss of shit chelsea fucking twat rubbish fucking fuck team. Deserve that LAST KICK FROM AGUERO !
####################
Conte saw the future in taking Costa if when he did.....he would definitely have received another yellow just because.....
####################
Aguero and Fernandinho will both miss the game against Arsenal. Wonderul
####################
@DeadlyAguero I've seen the light Aguero &gt; Costa
####################
Whaaaaaaat ? Give me a hell oh yeah ! He just got his ass whooped by Austin 316! https://t.co/FG06TTAgzO
####################
lmao I captained Hazard! litty
####################
Okay so who to get in for Aguero? Already have Costa... #FPL
####################
Only @ChelseaFC scored today@GaryJCahill Diego Costa@willianborges88 @hazardeden10 #MCLCHE3-1
####################
@ATrueNigerian he kept pushing him though. Fabregas stopped reacting. Leave it.
####################
Aguero is a turd... doubt his red will bother pep much as City seem to play better without him this season #MCICHE
####################
Aguero went 35% Rafael there. https://t.co/mRHj2lm4Wn
####################
Disgusting from Aguero that
####################
Cesc wanted none of Fernandinho the poof
####################
Absolute shocker of a challenge from #Aguero. Has done it before - once on Luis if I'm not mistaken. #MCICHE #notfootball
####################
Not surprised at the Aguero tackle the Argies always react in this way when they are losing saw it when Chile beat them twice #CopaAmerica
####################
Really aguero.....
####################
If Costa would have been on the pitch when the incident happened, he would have knocked down a couple of city players atleast :P
####################
Lmao why did the game end like that Abeg? White man foul white man, the black ihenacho and Fernandinho wan fight
####################
@cesc4official slapped @fernandinho in the face but nothing done???? #MCICHE
####################
Aguero, Fernandinho and Otamendi suspended for their next game, hopefully that's City dropping more points
####################
Told ppl for ages Aguero is a sly cunt , now ive been proven right , thank god a ref has some balls
####################
Aguero and Fernandinho should get long suspensions for violent conduct. Weak mental faculties are the reasons for these actions. #plfanzone
####################
@patrickkhall10 nothing about all the misses you had? De bruyne could have put the game away before Chelsea scored
####################
And I do hope Aguero feels the full force of the law.Such savagery should never be allowed anywhere in the game.
####################
I feel sorry for the unfortunate cunts who captained Aguero
####################
In the end, Chelsea had a more disciplined team on the pitch, a usual Diego Costa that we had under Mourinho would have fought today #MCICHE
####################
That is an absolute shocker from Aguero, potential leg breaker. Hope City fans don't try &amp; justify that one #MCICHE
####################
Aguero is a fucking disgrace #cfc #MCICHE #MCFCvCFC
####################
Like Aguero deserves a 6 game ban, that tackle was career ending!! In the words of SAF "He could've died!!!"
####################
That tackle was absolutely devastating , and Fernandinho is a prick
####################
I think not. You Kante win the league without Kante. #Beast. https://t.co/J6mvlOY57F
####################
Last week I took Augero and Fernandinho out and put Costa and Hazard in wow am I one lucky guy !!!
####################
@bateson87 i think Aguero out for 6 matches at least. What you think?
####################
@LobeyDosser1 I hadn't thought of that, but Ye, that was a disgrace. 3 match ban for him and Fernandinho, happy days
####################
Would have been a bar brawl :D :P https://t.co/StnnvuBnRa
####################
How much. Arsenal will still lose. RT @tomgunner14: Both Aguero and Fernandinho will miss the game against Arsenal.

You can't say Fabregas didn't deserve that the little snide.

####################
Shocking from Aguero, no place for that in football
####################
Fernandinho is really an asshole.
####################
Luis shldve booked blocking Aguero's run in first half. M.alonso clearly kicks Navas in box and few other occasions.
####################
Bravo is among the worse signings we have made!

Aguero that was shocking!!

Yes. Colenak.

####################
I know they won but if I was fabregas id be feeling like shit
####################
Disgusting from Aguero he should be banned for longer than 3 games that's a career ending challenge #cityvcfc
####################
Aguero deserves a lengthy ban for that 100%
####################
That was absolutely rank for Aguero
####################
Even fabregas flying over an advertising board, perfect
####################
But why did fernandinho pick fabregas and someone else.....

Ohh shit Fernandinho got sent off too lool

My only regret is taking the vice captaincy away from hazard.
####################
@bateson87 pushing someone off the field is a bit more aggresive than a alap, and a lot more obvious. Also aguero is a bitch
####################
I am dead sure that Fabregas was the one who started it against ferna but Aguero kick was just sheer frustration
####################
Aguero only doing to Chelsea what the rest of us wish we could #coys
####################
Even in Twickenham press room, consensus was that Aguero probably deserved two reds for that tackle on Luiz

Wht a game, Fabregas dissapearing over that advertising board the highlight hahaha

Fair play to Fabregas for not reacting to Fernandinho. Deserved to get floored the massive bellend.
####################
Brilliant counter attack football from Chelsea ...have to say what calm from fabregas with Fernandinho #MCICHE #PL

Fernandinho red for les than Chalobah. Cowardly little slap from Fabregas on him before his Red.

Absolutely. Good boy https://t.co/jl39iVCl37

Aguero suspended for the game against us. Touch
####################
@ManCity have 2 sent off Costa match as Chelsea beat Pep to go clear top. Finishing game with 9 seems modern trend after #NewcastleUnited
####################
How did Fabregas not retaliate fam
####################
Still disgusted by Aguero's challenge. He left both feet to attack David Luiz. Should be an extended ban. I'd suspend him until 2017.
####################
One of the best results of my life I reckon, what a team. Aguero is the scum of the earth, should be an 8 game ban. Amazing from chalobah
####################
Fucking disgusting of aguero. Absolute cunt.
####################
Bravo just didn't turn up today at all
####################
How many games do Aguero and Fernandinho get suspended?
####################
Fernandinho sent off also, for grabbing Fabregas round the neck and shoving him over advertising boards. Shocker.
####################
'Not that kind of player' right? https://t.co/FmD8A1yinI

Aguero will miss 3 games and Fernandinho should miss 5 for that. Disgusting from the City players. Just because they lost to a better team

Aguero as well. City completely imploded the way Spurs did in the spring

####################
@bateson87 he touched his face, Fernandinho gripped his throat several times and pushed him over the advertising boards into the city crowd
####################
aguero should getting a 3 match ban after than tackle on luiz. could've broken his leg
####################
aguero really doesn't like luiz https://t.co/TDonRd8xQy
####################
Dunno why Chelsea fans are saying 'If Costa was on the pitch' like Fernandinho wouldn't have him too
####################
Bravo fills me with confidence of a lost child.
####################
What is aguero doing
####################
Hart is far better than Bravo........ from worst to worst.
####################
Claudio Bravo is trash. Deserves to be dropped. How can you not save even one shot? Trash.
####################
Sergio Aguero always disappoints me when I put money on him.. But that red card at least cheers me up..
####################
#mciche Pep fucked up and #aguero  kicked like #streetfighter. What a ugly world :D
####################
Aguero should be given a 10 match ban and media scrutiny just like if Costa made that same tackle
####################
@harrywaz no points deduction it's only for the Arsenal. At least Aguero is out for our game in two weeks.
####################
Fabregas is a proper faggit getting pushed into the crowd
####################
Aguero and Fernandinho red carded in a last minute fracas against Chelsea.
Bitterness resulted from Aguero's nasty tackle on David Luiz.

Don't know what Fernandinho was piping up about the little bold prick

Very unprofessional from Aguero and Fenandinho
####################
@jakeashton1993 Aguero threw himself to the floor for that, if he hadn't been so theatrical you'd have got it

'Aguero isn't that type of player'
####################
Big win that! Just a shame footballers turn into girls at the end disgusting from aguero!
####################
Aguero gone for a minimum of 5 games.
####################
Fabregas didn't get pushed over the hoardings, he looked over his shoulder and took an extra step to fall over them. He's a sneak.
####################
If the FA don't give Fernandinho at least a three game ban
####################
Right..... (drops Aguero from @playtogga Perfect XI for next week)

####################
Very poor from Aguero. Wow that game could of gone either way
####################
Fernandinho and Aguero should be banned for a min of 5 games for that.
####################
Aguero and Fernandinho deserved their red cards
####################
When Hazard is playing like this, he is virtually unplayable. He has that swagger from 2 seasons ago.
####################
So Arsenal is facing many city without Aguero and Fernandinho I swear we are going to lose we don't win such games
####################
Wow.. what a fantastic game it was... So freaking glad Costa wasn't on the pitch when that incident happened..
####################
@Samkostfeit the "bump" that luiz gave Aguero was minimal, the only reason Aguero went down is because the ball was getting away from him 1
####################
What a terrible mentality from aguero. Pocketed by a 'shit' Brazilian with an Afro so he tried to end his career. Unlucky lad
####################
Aguero was my captain .ffs
####################
Lmao! How did Aguero n Fernandinho get red cards at d same time?
####################
I still like fabregas tho as an arsenal fan.
####################
Aguero deserves at least a fucking 6 match ban for that, watch him get a 3/4 match ban tho
####################
@paddypower Fabregas with the slap before it, horrible little bastard should get a ban for it

Aguero better receive a ban

@TomCrussell Fabregas is a little bitch too, he should get punished for that little slap he gave Fernandinho, needless
####################
Power mental Fabregas. Steadyyyyy.

Fernandinho should've seen the two yellow cards at the beginning of the game
####################
Aguero 3games, and a further 3 for Fernandinho.. that's some problems for the upcoming games. Can't be better yea ?
####################
Aguero is jst a fool
####################
Hazard is the best player in this league
####################
@Offical_odo is saying that. Of camera Fabregas may have done something. Any replays?

@Amar_SeMbHi_09 @ManCity can't react like that, they lost the plot, started with a push from Fernandinho. Aguero should get extended ban too
####################
Fernandinho is a bitch for that choke on Fabregas ...he deserves that red card and more punishment from the FA
####################
Diego Costa does it again
####################
Fair play to Gary Neville for sticking up for @chalobah defending his teammate after Aguero's reckless challenge on @DavidLuiz_4 #KTBFFH
####################
City fans boo the ref at the end of the game ! They need to take a good look at their own Aguero and Fernandinho - absolutely disgraceful !
####################
That's why Costa has always been in my FPL what a beast !!!
####################
Most surprisingly of all, in that scrap at the end Diego Costa's name wasn't mentioned once #MCICHE
####################
Aguero out of the game vs Arsenal, lovely
####################
Good bye Aguero .. https://t.co/04tThD1B4n
####################
Shocking challenge from Aguero on Luiz. Not for the first time either. If he and Fernandinho get 3 game bans, they miss the game against us.
####################
Lol did you see him picking on Fabregas, he seems like he can fight though https://t.co/613WVTvhYL
####################
Reacting like that is totally untypical for a Pep Guardiola team. Shameful, disgraceful behaviour by Aguero and Fernandinho. #MCFC
####################
Chelsea beat Manchester City 3-1 in Premier League. Costa, Willian and Hazard scored for the winners
####################
Hazard kxm
####################
There won't be much said about how Aguero turns into a nasty snide cunt when he's losing
####################
No dirty Fernandinho or aguero v us that's a result
####################
but Fernandinho is a LEGEND
####################
For real? https://t.co/iYRSYc5FH2
####################
Had it been Costa instead of Luiz, Aguero would be searching for a missing body part.

Had it been DC Costa crimes brigade would be out in full force https://t.co/KpccqKRI7n
####################
Reaction* https://t.co/n96DV82V01
####################
fabregas is a pussy for letting Fernandinho do that to him
####################
Unsavoury scenes to end the contest. Aguero sent off for a challenge on Luiz &amp; Fernandinho also sees red! https://t.co/QPghWF97km
####################
Diego Costa is a class above Aguero
####################
Surely fabregas has to be reprimanded for slapping fernandinho in the face???
####################
Fucking good https://t.co/sM3sCYwqH2
####################
Amazing how @cesc4official didn't react to that thug Fernandinho. Pure class!!
####################
Shame on the Fabregas doubters. Big ups @cesc4official master performance!
####################
Seems strange to say it, but I think that's Aguero done at City. He won't be there next season. #MCFCvCFC
####################
Aguero defiantly missing more than 1 game after that tackle, horrendous.
####################
Aguero deserves a 6 game ban, career ending tackle that, disgusting. Fabregas and Chalobah should get retrospective bans too.
####################
Aguero sent off for a horrible tackle but Fernandinhio deserves a 10 match ban for putting his hand on Fabregas throat and pushing him over
####################
safe to say fabregas acted like a pep guardiola player.
####################
Can't defend Aguero for that.
####################
Costa holdup play is remarkable
####################
Not at all condoning the Aguero tackle, but how does he allow Luiz to stay on the pitch is just a mystery.
####################
@DJRUSSKE Fabregas slapped Fernandinho first then tried played victim what'd you expect
####################
Thug RT @ChelseaFC: Fernandinho is also sent off. #MCICHE
####################
@Oyedele__ Aguero and Fernandinho need at least 5-game bans
####################
Aguero should've kicked himself for missing those chances he had.. had a very poor game
####################
All this talk about Costa on the TL has me feeling for a chai latte.
####################
We needed someone to snap him after he was in cahills face after the goal the little prick https://t.co/39uYti3z54

@CeeJayMcLeod Charlie Austin is the new aguero

That was a brutal challenge by Aguero. So late too in a decided match. 2nd red card this yr as well. Hope league comes down hard on him.

That calmness showed by Fabregas was pure class! #MCICHE

While Fernandinho was "Orubebe-ing", Cesc Fabegas just "Jega-ed". Amazing show of maturity.

Imagine having Aguero as your fantasy team captain #RIP

Aguero and Fernandinho out for a couple of games! Win tomorrow and go on a run for Christmas and could see ourselves close to top 4.
####################
See my God putting confusion in the camp of Mancity!
No Aguero&amp;Fernandinho against Arsenal.
####################
Couldn't believe Costa didn't get involved, Fernandinho needs to be banned for a while for that, such a disgrace to football.

#Fabregas has has to have said something there to Fernandinho surely?
####################
Manchester City didn't kill the game at 1-0. That De Bruyne miss was a huge. It cost them massively!
####################
Aguero lost it completely that was horrendous tackle on Luiz
####################
Hope that cunt aguero gets a 3 match ban
####################
Imagine thinking Fernandinho got the better of Fabregas, Cesc gave him a little slap, focused on the referee and made the red card happen.

Aguero has always had that violent streak in him ! Not the first time he has done this...deserves a 3 match ban ! #MCICHE
####################
Ref caused the handbags at the end. David Luis got away with a lot, and Aguero retaliated

Chalobah reaction 100% understandable, &amp; what on earth was Fernandinho doing. Embarrassing behaviour to push Cesc in throat towards crowd

####################
2016 what have you done! Costa is involved in a fight but to calm the belligerents down. The end is near. #mciche
####################
Think Bravo is absolutely key to what we're doing and Pep needs him to play, but also quite possible he's the worst goalkeeper in the league
####################
@Binnsphilip agree although fabregas shouldn't have escaped free , clear little slap
####################
That's the height of stupidity from Aguero and Fernandinho mind... game's gone, why lose it now missing for 3 games!?
####################
ningeeka Costa capt but... foolishness
####################
#MCICHE both deserved red but wonder if Fabregas will get retrospective action for his slap on Fernandinho which made him react
####################
Fair to say this ends any who's better De Bruyne bottled the game and his chances, Eden did not. #CFC
####################
That's disgusting from aguero, great game to watch from a neutral, felt like the type of big game you'd watch a few years ago
####################
Fernandinho fucking nutter
####################
Professionals acting out because they got beaten by the better team, pussies.
State of Aguero &amp; Fernandinho should be ashamed of themselves.

There's obviously a correlation between Aguero's nasty tackle and the accident with Luiz in the first half. #mciche

@trolleyLAMB @alanvanderhilst @evilbluebird uh, you know you have a guy named Costa on your team right?

Fabrgas did slap fernandinho though, I would done the same thing but I'm not being paid over 100k a week #cityvcfc

####################
Fantastic game! Diego Costa - best striker in the prem. Aguero good player but has a disgusting streak. 2 filthy dangerous tackles!
####################
@LGAmbrose probably more than three for Aguero, considering he's already been suspended for violent conduct this season.
####################
Big ugly scenes breaking out at #EtihadStadium and the shocking news is that Diego Costa is not involved.#MCICHE
####################
The @FA need to ban @fernandinho, guardiola and @aguerosergiokun 4 matches each.
####################
If Costa saw what Fernandinho did to Cesc he'd have gone ham
####################
@MessiMinutes he's an absolute thug mate! Fabregas gave him a wee slap just before it.
####################
Fuck all wrong with that Aguero challenge. Happens every Sunday up and down the country and rarely ends up with a booking
####################
no longer see Aguero as a good player now. fucking idiot.
####################
He really played Fernandinho there if you ask me. https://t.co/sWzDFIeSqF
####################
Wtf aguero think he bruce lee
####################
hazard is unstoppable
####################
- 2 points, no goal, aguero
####################
Shhh, don't put that in the air https://t.co/RMpub8AUjE
####################
@aguerosergiokun you are far from Costa's greatness. Just fuck off
####################
Aguero misses 4 games. One of which is against Arsenal.
####################
Costa probably say to heself "Boy if that was me I would have to get a red too cause booyyy" https://t.co/CDirWtIklv
####################
Aguero and Fernandinho go miss the game against us. Ope o
####################
Only owned Costa in #FPL for 2 weeks since he signed for Chelsea. Don't think it's been a problem until this season. He's so annoying.
####################
@TonyCascarino62 think Costa won that one!
####################
Good on Aguero, David Luiz is one of the dirtiest players in the game and he deserves to be hurt a lot worse than that. #MCICHE
####################
Aguero started all that fight!! Fuck him
####################
Thank God Costa was off before the drama he'd probably have been carded or even get suspended #MCICHE
####################
Yeah he did. I saw it too.  https://t.co/xSSjYNY5Aa
####################
@ChuBoi I know it don't count, but I think Costa won POTM today and Aguero is gone.
####################
You are bitter https://t.co/guiXWVnQQG
####################
@LaurenceRosen @dale_roots @JoshO567 no way fabregas has done nothing to provoke it. He's a cheeky little sod great player but
####################
Fernandinho should beat him up fuck FA charges mhn https://t.co/8DG1N75chn
####################
Cesc Fabregas with the unseen slap on Fernandinho, before the Brazilian retaliated. Hopefully, Taylor gets a ban with the players. #MCICHE
####################
@DaviidHaynes what did fernandinho do ? Only agueros challenge
####################
Fabregas is a pussy
####################
Loved the bit of afters as well. Happy with Aguero missing the Arsenal game.
####################
Like Fock !! He was on 4 or something a while ago  https://t.co/JkfE8q8NxS
####################
I should've made Costa my captain but I was convinced Chelsea and City would draw https://t.co/fTwCz0WzL6
####################
Nasty frustration from Aguero and Ferdanhino at the end though
####################
Fabregas should be embarrassed ahah
####################
As innnn https://t.co/TMzECgKQ4h
####################
Lol he is sorry https://t.co/xZ2GSWdkwi
####################
Aguero is going to be kicked from my fpl team fucker
####################
Miss from De Bruyne was the most critical moment of the game. #MCICHE
####################
Embarrassing at the end there from City. Aguero with a horror tackle.
####################
Manchester City are sore losers...
Fernandinho was all over Fab...
Should be suspended for more than 3 games...
#MCICHE #CFC #PL
####################
That's some tackle from Aguero. https://t.co/2XWFYhrFYR
####################
Oh and AGUERO will get sent off
####################
Man of the match easily #Costa #CFC https://t.co/rTKs9WuC8M
####################
@aripfk @fernandinho meow
####################
@Claspie you must have seen something I didn't...
Opinion of Aguero? lol
####################
@J4CKMULLx lovely slap by fabregas to get him to react, plus chalobah should have gone.
####################
He'll also need another striker. Someone who offers something a little different from Aguero. https://t.co/WKE2oyRf07
####################
Kudos to fabregas for staying calm despite being knocked to the ground literally
####################
@JonnyBoyQPR no he pushed fabregas where as Barton kneed the player..
####################
I shock sef say he nor fight today https://t.co/a1KLJEdFWa
####################
Fabregas should've kicked fernandinho in the cock after that shit but what happened in the crowd ?
####################
niceeeee https://t.co/a3Rlmlvrzu
####################
Good striker with an asshole attitude https://t.co/JD14lLEmv3
####################
There should be atleast 3 match ban for aguero @FA
####################
This new Costa. Calm, focused, disciplined. Conte is a boss. Nuff said.
####################
Touch Fabregas again and I will show you, yoy sad fuck of a person.
####################
Fabregas not reacting was the best thing ever.
####################
Aguero is a world class player, but that tackle was disgusting. I'm all for passion, but @ManCity we're such sore losers at the end #MCICHE
####################
Lol but Aguero fool oh, wey tackle that?
####################
They definitely will. https://t.co/Ub0AUG8kAa
####################
@footballmood I guess he missed the part where Cesc provoked with the soft slap that set Fernandinho off
####################
Love the passion but no need for Fernandinho to kick off like that
####################
You have all my backing to repeat that to anyone and everyone https://t.co/IGgeaoDpQg
####################
Thought World War III was going to start at the end of that game! What a shocking tackle from Aguero!
####################
@Shaunyboy75 lost the plot there didn't they? That Aguero challenge was disgraceful.
####################
I'm so glad that I transferred out Aguero on my team for this weekend. #fpl
####################
Just in case you didn't know. This aguero- luiz rivalry didn't start today.... https://t.co/Ubi2AQAEvx
####################
You could've seen Chelsea fans at Half Time - angry at Cahill
####################
Chelsea on the counter is absolutely frightening. Class to watch. Can't stand Costa but he bullied City. Title favourites. #Chelsea
####################
Anyone saying bravo is a better goalkeeper than Hart is deluded. Worst keeper in Bpl #MCICHE
####################
Fabregas is such a little bastard https://t.co/wVHVHGnRah
####################
@garrypl he did out his hand up into Fernandinho's face
####################
Bully* https://t.co/tEyaKCFwxq
####################
I always thought last year that Kante is the main reason for #lcfc success https://t.co/f1hFEFhAnD
####################
Bachuwai and Fabregas sparked a red card for Fenandinho! FA has to have a second look at that! Chelsea won because of the referee thou!
####################
@SkyFootball disgrace to football Fernandinho! Fabregas did well not to react back.Aguero lost his head not like him that.
####################
Fabregas should've been sent off for slapping Fernandinho. The FA will clearly have their say on that. For Chalobah as well. #MCICHE
####################
Selling Aguero immediately and the annoyance was my captain, just spoilt all the work Diego Costa did shit
####################
Disgusting by Aguero should be more then a 3 match ban. If that was Costa .....
####################
Disgusting https://t.co/gI9GgiS8mu
####################
That was a nice cowards challenge by aguero fair play....
####################
@luntCFC I would've punched fernandinho for what he did
####################
That was a disgraceful tackle by Aguero
####################
Aguero n Luiz have previous, poor discipline City at the end.
####################
No Aguero and Fernandinho for the next two games and also they can both be banned for a couple of games for their behavior #PL #MCICHE
####################
Scrap at the Etihad. Aguero &amp; Fernandinho reds correct but Cesc instigated then played possum. Agree with @GNev2: defend your team mates.
####################
Look at all these idiots calling Fabregas 'soft' for not retaliating to Fernandinho's aggression. He knew what he was doing.
####################
@ClinicalKev Fabregas rustled Fernandinho what a lad
####################
*Start https://t.co/DkG03DaWcg
####################
Aguero is a petulant baby when things aren't going his way.  Absurd challenge.
####################
If it was Costa who produced that nasty tackle, everyone would be mad~ but since it's Aguero, everyone seems okay with it~
####################
Fabregas makes #Chelsea return at Man City https://t.co/XMXERkPBsI #MCICHE https://t.co/asyeLQeYm4
####################
Fabregas is so wise. He didn't even touch fernandinho.. That will be like a 3 match ban!
####################
Manchester City didn't kill the game at 1-0. That De Bruyne miss was huge. It cost them massively!
####################
That De Bruyne miss made the difference
####################
@Hayzee_Forbes Fabregas started the confrontation
####################
Pep will play kdb up top and we will draw 1-1 https://t.co/WlcYnrsaCA
####################
Fabregas should be suspended for that. What a coward he is, snake really is a suitable nickname for him.

City couldn't give us a draw result. BAd result https://t.co/yvbND9kem5

####################
We need joe hart back.I don't like this Claudio Bravo. #cityvcfc #citychelsea
####################
did fabregas slap fernandinho first??? cheeeeeeeky prick
####################
Poor finishing and an even poorer defence cost us again. I'm ashamed of those actions at the end. No excuses for the Aguero red card
####################
@NBCSportsSoccer FUCKING GOAT WHAT A GOAL THIS WAS , I FUCKING LOVE U COSTA
####################
Both Aguero and Fernandinho will miss 3 vital games Leicester, Watford and Arsenal.
City slayed by Conte's army for sure #MCICHE
####################
something Duttymouth would do. https://t.co/CeJrwMumFd
####################
@ESPNFC thanks for4  winning this match. Hazard.
####################
Fabregas should have done Fernandinho's head in ffs. Proper cunt
####################
It's alright @ManCity, Aguero kicked David Luiz instead of a bottle, so he won't face serious repercussions as per the @FA logic.
####################
Yey now we'll only lose 3-0 https://t.co/txmmvstSG6
####################
Honestly teams get away with so much against Chelsea .... last season Spurs now City. Fernandinho and Aguero need 5 game bans
####################
Fabregas, kill yourself
####################
Aguero was very poor today, very very poor
####################
Aguero man you're part of fantasy team you ediat!
####################
4 match ban would mean #aguero is eligible for #LFC game 31.12
####################
yes no aguero..thank you.aguero actually fuck ups fantasy league
####################
What on earth was Aguero thinking, 4 game ban for dangerous play incoming. Chelsea will get the plaudits, but City should have been 4 up
####################
SHIT tackle from Aguero but absolutely nasty from Fernandhino. Appalling.
####################
@jakeMivill Fernandinho chickening Fabregas; amazing.
####################
Fabregas will get a ban
####################
Aguero's tackle on Luiz was brutal. No intention of playing the ball.
####################
If only Costa was still on the pitch for that fight
####################
@LiamPaulCanning some fans will say aguero shows passion
####################
@allannamanya_ hahaha fernandinho..wat was he trying to do
####################
That was a bad bad challenge by aguero he'll get 3 or 4 games for that
####################
Look att Cesc geting Fernandinho sent off, still loves Arsenal doesn't he
####################
Credit to Fabregas. I'd have decked the guy*

*sat safety on the back row of the bench not getting involved cos I'm a massive pussy
#MCICHE
####################
@Stats_4_footie @BrettHogantips sure Fabregas put a slap in there first and then bottled it lol
####################
@ManCity that tackle by @aguerosergiokun is something I would expect from Costa.
####################
2 city players sent off but i think that 2-5 players for chelsea should have been sent off:
Chalobah
Batshuayi
Fabregas
Courtois
Cahill
####################
What a despicable thug this Fernandinho is. #MCICHE
####################
Highlights of the match (1) Poor refereeing (2) Aguero and Luiz's love story
####################
So whoever N'Golo Kante plays for wins the league? Is that how football works now? #CFC

Aguero is a fucking wasteman
####################
Pretty poor from Aguero... but exceptions should be made of its against that particular clown.
####################
@leith_craig I think Aguero has already had one 3-game ban this season...
####################
@T_Daley Exactly right. It would be "back to the studio now for sentence". Aguero has previous with Luiz. Dirty little sh*t.
####################
All Aguero owners;

Sell Kun for Costa.
Costa gets booked.
Buy back Aguero.
####################
@DatGuyRambo @shexwore @Adeel_AFC @ChampionsLeague @cesc4official 
And how many EPL titles Fabregas won with you? Thought so.
####################
Fernandinho. What a thug
####################
but ty chelsea no aguero for us we tenk god
####################
Fabregas made contact with Fernandinho 's face first if you didn't notice.
####################
What a fucking scumbag Aguero is
####################
Hazard will win the ballon d'or in the future 100%

Classic pep game against Chelsea, lots of chances, no win. Everything changed after de Bruyne missed sitter while leading. #MCICHE

The match between City vs Chelsea today, speaks the quality of City and the volume of Aguero's &amp; Fernandinho's frustration.
####################
Aguero's had several filthy incidents but has the polar opposite of Costa, it's ridiculous.
####################
Aguero better get a 5 game suspension for that tackle and it's not the first time against luiz
####################
Aguero tackle was shocking valid red.. And also ferandinho for red card...  Shocking ending

That was an extremely poor tackle from Aguero ! Have a nice spell m9 #MCICHE

i lost all respect for aguero after that tackle
####################
Your welcome Arsenal fans, no aguero and no fenan for your game lads
####################
Chelsea are back in form home and away.

Diego Costa back to his best.
####################
Aguero should get a 10 match ban, already suspended this season too. Filthy pond life
####################
@Matt_Law_DT credit to Conte for getting Costa to keep a lid on his anger.
####################
Great win for @ChelseaFC today. Disgusting behaviour from City at the end. Aguero deserves a lengthy ban. Top of the league.

@ManCity poor conduct @aguerosergiokun @fernandinho great performance @ChelseaFC @hazardeden10 @diegocosta @willianborges88 great coach.

Fabregas did so well to control himself
####################
Somebody with a video of the Aguero red ? Pls #BPL #CFC #MCFC
####################
Shameful by Aguero. Lost his head. Completely out of character but that's an inexcusable tackle.
####################
Aguero should get more than 3 games for that challenge despite it being on Luiz. Not the first time he's done either
####################
Lol fabregas slapped Fernandinho so it's not all his fault
####################
Aguero's head was on another planet
####################
Costa always lit
####################
Gabriel Jesus is taking Aguero's place the second he's eligible to play.
####################
Fact. https://t.co/BlJbUwSIVW
####################
FPL  ooo
Aguero red card.... My chwesssttttttt
####################
I have no doubt Luiz works Aguero up. Like Carvalho, he's good like that. Great match, great end. Well done.
####################
and everyone says costa's is much of a bigger cunt. not realising that aguero is up there contesting. https://t.co/p0nEBoFmb7

####################
Disgusting from Aguero he should be banned for longer than 3 games that's a career ending challenge. scum
####################
Aguero and Fernandinho need to have a long hard look at themselves #MCICHE #EPL
####################
Hope aguero gets 7 or 8 games for that, say what you want about Costa but he was twice the player Aguero was in every way today

Aguero and Fernandinho miss the game against Arsenal. We'll lose 2-1 instead of 3-0 now, excellent

Pep should not have sold joe until he had the goalie he wanted. The defenders were comfortable with joe. They don't trust bravo
####################
@j_davies2801 Aguero the dirty little cunt
####################
Dump dem up plz https://t.co/jMFZb8JoqJ
####################
Fabregas lucky there. He provoked Fernandinho with a slap (or something). Fernandinho  shouldn't have reacted like that though. Silly.
####################
If Suarez had made that challenge that Aguero done sky sports would dedicate a channel to Paul Pogba
####################
If Costa flies in like that it's a 10 game ban lolll we'll see what the FA do
####################
Listen Fabregas turned up todayyy
####################
Sergio Aguero will miss 4 games as he has been sent off earlier this season. He will miss most of the Dec games including Arsenal  #MCICHE
####################
@pwmccorm121690 @City_Watch Pep can't be blamed for individual errors. But sure, the Bravo purchase looks terrible atm
####################
Cesc slapped Fernandinho 1st then acted like he's the innocent one here. Fernandinho went too far as well. Scenes! Touch of bosti football.
####################
Hahaha Fabregas is such a snake. Gives a slap and cries victim when the other Fernandinho retaliates.
####################
Why PEP took Sane' off and left Silva on weeks me
####################
Not really from both sides, it was just City players! https://t.co/RCztW00wMY

@Greg_YNWA1 @MisterpaulW Nitpicking: Still don't trust Cahill and Luiz. And I think Moses + Alonso playing outta their skin. Bt strong team.

Fernandinho you're a cunt
####################
Where's my costa! Hahahhahaa https://t.co/2zX7ifveBF
####################
Tbf City had chances esp De Bruyne should have made it 2-0 different game probably if that went in shocking miss bt Chelsea looking scary
####################
So Sergio gets a red for his tackle but Adrian Luiz and bravo don't
####################
Dirty c**nts "@ChelseaStuff24: This is not Aguero's first time. Fucking cunt. https://t.co/z1sRgz7U2V"

Disgraceful shit from Aguero smh...
####################
Fernandinho's like that friend we all have that's got your back in a fight and will ask questions later.#MCICHE
####################
Bravo is literally wank
####################
It's not the first time Aguero has tried to injure Luiz.
####################
@coachjj84 the ball from fabregas + chest from Costa was probably most beautiful play I've seen in a while.

And I hate Costa
####################
Just saw the Aguero foul wow he fully went for a double leg snapper
####################
Wha do them batty boy ya from city Fernandinho!
####################
What a tit aguero is, can't defend that!
####################
@kittyglitter Aguero two footed Luiz after losing possession... Fernandinho pushed Snake Fabresuck into the stands... ohhhh the scenes!

Fabregas the ultimate calm haha
####################
And #Fernandinho geezer got pocketed all day all he's good for is a lunge #headloss

@TrueGeordieNUFC twat of the week to aguero

Brilliant win, 3 brilliant Goals from Costa, Willian and Hazard. Amazing Game and 3 amazing points. Well Done! @ChelseaFC #CFC
####################
It feels so good. Not just because of the win, Aguero and Fernandinho shows how small that fucking club is. Weak mentality.
####################
@ConorRourke absolutely criminal that is. Fernandinho's a mug too
####################
Man City play Leicester, Watford and Arsenal in the next 3 weeks - probably without Aguero.
####################
Aguero has a right nasty streak in him, not even the first time he's pulled something like that on Luiz.
####################
@tobie_chapman Tbf ref was horrid and should've nipped the nastiness in the bud earlier. Don't know what took him so long to send off Aguero
####################
@JakeJK93 Fernandinho was offering everyone on haha
####################
Fabregas taken play acting to a new level, diving over an advertising board. Biggest prick in football
####################
Aguero was done today.. Luis had him in his back pocket all game.. Even his cheap tricks failed.. So he chose to end Luiz career.. shameful!
####################
Great tackle from Aguero though!! #MCICHE
####################
#hot teen sex dad photo bravo black nude girl https://t.co/f09AYYlNZx
####################
Chelsea are fucking shiteee and fabregas is a fucking wanker #MCICHE
####################
Sergio Aguero sent off for fouling David Luiz who should have been sent off in first half for fouling Aguero.
####################
Well, that's understandable https://t.co/PK01NgSK7O
####################
A very mature &amp; disciplined Midfielder/Quarterback @cesc4official didn't react to @Fernandinho multiple assaults.  https://t.co/K8CAiShFZX
####################
Aguero really doesn't like David Luiz
####################
Frustrated https://t.co/thScl2ff2x
####################
Fernandinho I would not start a fight with Antonio Conte, only one winner there. Disgusting challenge from Aguero on luiz.
####################
Hold on, if Mourinho kicks a bottle he gets sent off and banned for a game, let's see if the FA will ban Aguero and Fernandinho...
####################
@BrazilEdition wish he tried that with costa the cunt
####################
Look at it again. Fernandinho hand already around Fab's neck. Deluded Manc https://t.co/2BYuOSynvE
####################
@___Prometheus two wrongs don't make a right - what Aguero did then was unacceptable
####################
Defensive masterclass, pep the tactical genius. https://t.co/saEGkst6qV
####################
Brilliant game of football..Aguero should be arrested for that challenge..Luiz can be a prick but that was just criminal..
####################
Should be at least a 3-match ban for Aguero. Clear intent to injure there. Absolutely disgusting.
####################
City battered Chelsea first half, but Chelsea came out swinging 2nd half. Costa was amazing. Both teams back lines need serious work #MCICHE
####################
@NeilPatell mate it was great fabregas got sonned by Fernandinho
####################
Diego Costa is so effective
####################
@FootyMemes kudos to Fabregas keeping calm
####################
Aguero for no reason just subtracted points from me...
####################
But Fabregas started it tho, did yall see the small slap he gave Fernandinho that instigated his reaction...
####################
I've had enough of Aguero he's out the squad next week #fpl
####################
That Keven miss was the straw that broke the Horse's back for me https://t.co/4APuzQFwW4

If they gave Xhaka 3 games, they habe to give Aguero at least 5
####################
Aguero deserves a 30 match ban for that tackle shocking
####################
Captain Costa!!! Go and grab me a couple more fella
####################
If he is Suarez,  it might be 8 games banned. https://t.co/a7MmN8hAc8
####################
Can't believe I'm saying it but Costa is actually the best striker in the prem (atm)
####################
That useless piece of shit https://t.co/7DvkVQsI1k
####################
Aguero and Fernandinho both got dtraight reds for violent conduct. 3 game bans for them!
####################
@fernandinho what were you thinking mate, come on!
####################
That Aguero challenge can't only be a 3 match ban
####################
LOL RUN IN? More like hand to the throat FOUR TIMES https://t.co/ZAYzeFghNS
####################
Aw Fernandinho and aguero thinking they're madmen let's see how mad they are in the stands the next three games
####################
If the @FA have got anything about them, they'll ban Aguero for at least 10 games after that tackle. Disgusting behaviour
####################
Fernandinho figa say he be stupid erh. Kwasiaaaa. Dem for give am 6 matches. Idiot
####################
An embarrassing end to the game from @mancity 3 games ban for fernadinho and Aguero surely #cfc
####################
Aguero got the ball.
####################
Chalobah came to the defence of David Luiz and pushed Aguero over. Pure class. Fabregas played it cool and got Fernandinho red carded.
####################
We guess #Chelsea are top of the table for a reason #Diego #Harlesden #MCFC #Cahill #Uxbridge  #LondonIsOpen #GiveUsAWave #Hazard #Willian

####################
Said fabregas looked lost in the 1st half, he must of read my tweet at HT and made that pass, great ball that
####################
Complete indiscipline from Man City players at the end Aguero rightly sent off Fernandinho and Iheanacho shouldn't have done what they did.
####################
@chn_arsenal Aguero's tackle and red card very stupid. They'll need wins in the coming matches to keep pace.

How mad is it that Kante is going to win two premier leagues in a row with two different clubs, mental when you think about it.
####################
If it was Costa the media would've ask for jail.
####################
@Stubbs89 a three match ban for aguero would be woefully insufficient. Diego would receive at least 6
####################
How good was Diego Costa today tho?
####################
Hopefully Fernandinho will get a lengthy ban

Aguero. Utter Cunt. His gesture on Cahill OG. Tackles on Luiz today.

I SUPPORT A CLUB THAT INSISTS ON PLAYING KOLAROV AT CENTRE BACK AND BRAVO IN GOAL BUT WANTS TO WIN THE LEAGUE HAHAHAHAHAHAHA NO GOODBYEEEEEE
####################
@bensmith130 but surely Cesc slap fernandinho at start,
####################
@VindiTweets he brushed fernandinho face when sepadatjng. He took it as deliberate
####################
Fernandinho and Aguero getting a Ben Thatcher ban would be sensational.
####################
Regardless, was harsh of Fernandinho. https://t.co/8Ui5a0kl60

Should've scored 4. Conceded 2. Could've conceded more. We'll win fuck all with Kolarov as a first choice defender.

####################
Aguero and Fernandinho will be missing for the arsenal game I like that lol

@nv_raja Wish Costa was there in pitch during fight.

Aguero red card. 0 point deh
####################
Fernandinho is a noob don't know how has he made his place in a guardiola side #MCICHE
####################
Gotta say though, if De Bruyne scores we probably lose. #MCICHE
####################
de bruyne is the most over rated player in the prem
####################
That should be a prison sentence for Aguero, possibly career ending tackle! That was an assault #CFC #MCICHE @premierleague @UKSupremeCourt
####################
So Aguero will be banned for how long?  Need to declutter my team
####################
Second time that Aguero has intentionally tried to injure Luiz. Great striker, terrible human. #MCICHE
####################
Diego Costa Is The Best Striker In The Prem No One Can Ever @ Me
####################
Costa came off injured but he ran off that bench quick time. Class from Fabregas to hold his cool there. Any way... Commeee onnnnnn #MCICHE
####################
Can't make up mind up who Chelsea's best player was the ref or Kolarov .
####################
Cesc Fabregas needs to take a bow
####################
Aguero and Fernandinho should be given life bans...based on what you can get for kicking a water bottle these days anyway....
####################
Shame on Aguero and Fernandiho, this attitude shouldn't be tolerate on a football pitch. Well done Chelsea

@darrellanders_ Played well as well. De Bruyne bottled an open net which would have ended the game

Aguero's tackle was just embarrasing. Fernandinho acting all tough as well. We got in their heads.

Fabregas gets away with the slap but Fernadinho rightfully sent off

Huge win for clinical Chelsea. De Bruyne miss super costly. Aguero's a dick and Fabregas is sneaky

I'd love to smash up Fernandinho as well

Fabregas is absolute scum.

@KelechiKarma you didn't make that many mistakes though, 2 counter attacks and Costa simply being stronger

As always, post-match analysis will ignore the fact that the game probably ends differently if De Bruyne hadn't missed an open net.

Imagine if we lose to City now.
No Aguero or Fernandinho

@Conteholic  Who assisted the first goal? Who motioned Marcos Alonso to go for an instant cross to Hazard. You think you know football.
####################
@couldbemoh smartest thing since his pass to Costa
####################
Ugly end to the match. Have to say, Fabregas slapped Fernandinho before he started pushing. Aguero 100% deserved that red, though.
####################
@yew1e LOL. Sorry o. Na Sanchez I captain. Did not trust anyone in Chelsea or City. Should have stuck with Costa

If Aguero broke His leg, it would have been the refs fault... but not many would see that

That was horrible Aguero. So disappointed! Straight outta my FPL.

If that was Suarez or Costa they would have been given a 3 month ban
####################
Manchester City 1-3 Chelsea Football Club Eden Hazard Goal Video Highlight! https://t.co/mZR8fld8zo
####################
That was petty and shocking from Aguero
####################
Gotta be lengthy bans for fernandinho and Aguero
####################
@cultofwilson he deserved the red... as did aguero and maybe Chalobah
####################
Fabregas very classy there when confronted by the very unclassy Fernandinho.
####################
Fabregas is bigger than Pep. #Pepisbald
####################
Aguero with his best Bruce Lee impression on Luiz. 

Fucking midget prick.
####################
Fabregas is very smart guy
####################
So much cunt https://t.co/EpUE3thnMu
####################
Dosgusting tackle!! Second suspension for Aguero this season... Now imagine if that was Costa? #bbcfootball
####################
@clivepafc Great spectacle. No Aguero and Fernandinho against Arsenal.
####################
Why did Fernandinho get sent off?
####################
@TrueGeordieNUFC did u watch the game?? City dominated all game and de bruyne missed a sitter
####################
Aguero is better than Costa#MCICHE https://t.co/Z9xC9D90QT
####################
@ChelseaFC @DavidLuiz_4 @willianborges88 Chelsea fans. Please help take action against what aguero tried to do to Luiz. Career ending tackle
####################
Aguero and Fernandinho both red carded. #MCICHE
####################
@Claspie Did he do anything there? I guess he said sth to Fernandinho? That reaction wasnt called for though
####################
Can see Fabregas charged also.... https://t.co/MQCqKnAbgR
####################
@KcKelani well played Cesc for not reacting. Thats a 3 match ban for Fernandinho. Misses #AFCvMCFC
####################
I tire oh, poor performance https://t.co/OKZx2ZUvse
####################
I am not even bias, Chelsea is the best team in the EPL. Having Hazard and Costa in form they'll win it all.We've been here before #CFC
####################
Thanks Aguero..
####################
@Gusupreme the man is about to bench aguero
####################
Fabregas bitch slapped Fernadinho first
####################
Aguero out of the game v Arsenal. Negative is that Fernandinho also misses out. Do not rate him at all
####################
Disgusting by Aguero should be more then a 3 match ban. If that was Costa .....
####################
@modrisxelba dawg watch a replay. Hazard had fullllll control of the ball all the way. Bravo was in no man's land. Never was gonna reach
####################
Fair enough. He's not Fernandinho though. https://t.co/BxHWPWBscE
####################
That's shocking from Aguero. Got to get an extended ban for that.
####################
However, fair play to Fernandinho. Once you've lost your head you've got to follow through
####################
Are we really surprised Aguero pulled that stunt? https://t.co/kTkYAMqegn
####################
@venkiraja Yeah..thought Fabregas was very good too...
####################
@Hurrikane10P ha kane over Costa.... They are 10 clear of us
####################
Diego Costa leaving The Etihad... https://t.co/xADt2cQisz
####################
Without Fernandinho City will still control the midfield v us lol
####################
@GaryLineker Not necessarily Kante but the change of guards and formation has helped Chelsea immensely.
####################
That challenge from aguero was disgusting. No wonder chalobah went over and decked him
####################
If Man City don't get extra suspensions for Aguero and Fernandinho then the @fa have lost any shred of credibility they had. Vile team
####################
Mind when Aguero was sound? That tackle wasn't sound. Great win for Chelsea!
####################
@ManCity stop playing fucking 3 at the back.it does not fucking work. aguero and fernandinho lost their fucking heads. patheitc. embarrasing
####################
Pep schooled Conte only for Aguero to bottle
####################
People calling Cesc a pussy calma he'll knock Fernandinho out behind closed doors
####################
Otamendi is one of the worst defenders i've ever seen, spinned like a Beyblade and bullied to the max by Costa and co
####################
Fabregas is such a legend

Assist for costa's goal
Assist for Fernandiho's red card
####################
Leniency...cos of Chapecoense!!! https://t.co/O2twouCsG1
####################
Surely Fernandinho has to get more than a 3 game ban, fabgregas didn't even retaliate and he kept his hand on his throat
####################
Fernadinho treated fabregas like a bitch lol
####################
The fact that Conte has tamed Costa so much that he isn't even involved in the fight is amazing!!
####################
@jayutd1999 @jasoncundy05 yeah what is the score? #costa #hazard #willian
####################
City fucked up that ending fernandinho the fucking retard
####################
Red cards from Aguero &amp; Fernandinho has made my @bbcmotd viewing more entertaining! #MCICHE
####################
@Cerebrone lol. Did you happen to delete your tweet of Aguero getting two goals?
####################
As others have said about Bravo today - not quite the shot-stopping efforts you'd want to see. He seems to lean/guess too early, too often.
####################
Aguero and Fernandinho banned for game against us?! Hope so! Frauds
####################
Oh god. Can it get any worse?!?! Aguero off AND fernad
####################
Aguero should get a lot more than a 3 game ban for that tackle
####################
Lol doe play wid fernandinho https://t.co/OrH1oyTYUG
####################
@SuperSportTV Fernandinho received a slap from Fabregas that's why he reacted in that manner, I'm not condoning it though. #MCICHE #PL
####################
@oliverlines147 @nr147 if Costa did that he would be hung drawn and quartered! Aguero will get away with 3 match ban
####################
Withdrew Aguero from my fantasy team.......wise move after that disgraceful display!
####################
CESC FABREGAS had a huge role in every goal we scored today but according to twitter experts he was invisible. 

#MAESTRO
####################
As I said earlier,, Brilliant assist from Costa to William to give Chelsea the lead.
Completely bembuzelled Otamendi.
#cityvcfc

####################
That tackle by aguero was disgusting
####################
@Moinul123 Fabregas slapped him first ya nonce
####################
Fuck off Aguero! You stat pad asshole. Finally got what you deserved.
####################
@NickWestonAFC did you see what Fernandinho did to Cesc the fa won't act tho.
####################
@brentisoccer13 you guys started fighting. Aguero and Fernandihno straight red lol
####################
Fernandinho went crazy at the end there hahaha
####################
@EwanMCFC So De Bruyne missing caused 3 Chelsea goals &amp; stopped another 2 city goals? Or?..
####################
Shoutout @fernandinho for that exceptional display of professionalism. Learn to lose you gimp
####################
Absolute state of City's mentality. Folded once it went 1-1 and then once 2-1 lost all discipline and what Aguero did was embarrassing.
####################
Luis Suarez gets an extended ban if that was him making the challenge on Luiz. I predict the normal 3 match ban for Aguero.
####################
Disgusting scenes at #mancity Aguero and Fernandinho should be ashamed of themselves. #growup #MNCCHE #pathetic #badlosers
####################
Awful Aguero challenge full stop. Fabregas went over the barrier a bit to easily after slapping Fernandinho. Taylor was abysmal #mcfc
####################
@KurtZouma come and bench cahill jor

Big shout out to those who captained aguero. #FPL

####################
@pvbsc1 he made of meal of the fall but Fernandinho had him by the neck before that
####################
Aguero is just mad he didn't get his 5 penalties that he usually gets every game. #MCICHE
####################
Hahahhaa Cesc slapped Fernandinho, so him not reacting was pointless, he's banned too.
####################
@CHRISGEORGE14 so glad I didn't captain Aguero...
####################
Aguero banned 3 matches, misses Arsenal game come on yessssssss
####################
Aguero should be out 10 games for that tackle. One of the dirtiest Ive ever seen. Went straight for the knee with 2 feet and viciousness
####################
Fabregas is a proper man. That level of control is wow
####################
@Chelseabible1 Man City played dirty from the start. They had good moments but we deserved the win. Fernandinho should've been off sooner.
####################
Shame Fernandinho didn't fancy showing that much bravery with the ball at his feet. Pathetic bloke
####################
@giggsclass i'd feel the same but it was smart. He did the right thing, he won't get a ban and Fernandinho will
####################
there is a strong if somewhat amoral case for Luiz as man of the match https://t.co/Z6JQZmSfjs

####################
Costa, willian, hazard
####################
I woke up just in time for that Hazard goal!! That was pure wickedness. My guy stoned that net!!!
####################
Cesc taunting Fernandinho is the best shit I've see all year
####################
Bravo - I'm sorry but he is allowed to make himself big and get close to saving chances 

Too easy to beat
####################
Fabregas rustler, he's one of us.
####################
To lose ur minds for your mistakes is not cool.. Fernandinho we can understand but wat Aguero did was inexcusable #ManCityvsChelsea
####################
Even Messi is https://t.co/g9hIzkUSBW

Fernandinho likely to be suspended for a few games after that choke grab on Fabregas. #KweseSports
####################
Yep! Really good match. Aguero and Fernadinho out the Arsenal match too I think. Proper way to end a great game https://t.co/10TnDM5S5Z
####################
That player is disgusting  https://t.co/VpwC37dDtS
####################
Augero the pig and pep the "magician" must get banned for their behavior today! Sarcastically applauding the ref! Aguero horror challenge!
####################
Aguero ever being considered top CF in EPL is embarrassing for the league tbh
####################
Honestly hope Fernandinho is punished beyond the three game ban. Admired the guy until today but this was fucking disgraceful.
####################
Costa kept Otamendi in his pocket, 2 red cards and Fabregas assisted. I love this game.
####################
Oi Fernandinho, if you're gonna grab someone by the neck on a football pitch, make sure you taste blood.  Same punishment.
####################
Aguero has been awful for most of this season. Far from the form he had 2 seasons ago.
Iheanacho better make the most of this opportunity.
####################
De Bruyne cost Manchester City the game. Has he scores that open goal? Manchester City would have won that.
####################
@ChristianJ1995 @Itani I'm not saying they had a good game Im just saying bravo needs to sort out his problems and so does r entire defense
####################
What a turnaround that was! Trailing at the break, goals from Diego Costa, sub Willian and Hazard secure a great 3-1 win. #MCICHE
####################
I'm a big fan of this https://t.co/ZLS98U33EO

Aguero with the disgusting tackle and Fernandinho's thuggish behaviour. Terrible way to end an otherwise fun match

@GashThom @ChrisN_H That's the refs fault not ours. Aguero didn't need to do that at all
####################
Got to give it to Fabregas. Just look how calm and composed he was when Fernandinho was goinf mental. Could have easily rehtaliated.
####################
Cesc is sly. He gave him a petty slap. https://t.co/S4LquS8Wze

Aguero please go and miss some matches, you deserve it.

Aguero wanted Christmas off clearly. Great result in the end for Utd.

Behenchod he was my FPL captain. https://t.co/5PRcBvbwY8
####################
So.. Technically @ChelseaFC  beat @ManCity 0:3... Cahill just saved them from much shame
####################
Fernandinho is a fuckin wanker, not one bit of him is professional at all
####################
Cesc is a better man than I. I would have sent Fernandinho's head into the stands if he grabbed my neck.
####################
As good as Aguero is, he is a cunt
####################
If someone came out and said Jose deserves a 6 match ban for kicking a bottle, surely Aguero deserves a 10 match ban for that.
####################
@fernandinho Very Very Horrible Sportsmanship...... No Respect
####################
3 game bans for aguero and fernandinho at the very least. could be helpful for us.
####################
Slapped Fernandinho across the face and then fell back over the advertising hoardings after a little push. What a little bitch.

Horrendous tackle by Aguero and neck grab by Fernandinho, but Fabregas did slap him. Amazing how Fabregas didn't do anything.
####################
Now there's no aguero and fernandinho for the next three games. Absolutely unnecessary
####################
Didn't Aguero get pushed as well? Where's the Chelsea red?

Surprised the City fans didn't grass on Fabregas for being in their section. 'Ger em oot'.

####################
@asaad_utd Fernandinho grabbed his neck and squeezed it before Cesc did anything

Aguero should be banned for at least a month for that horrific challenge

@tips_fpl time to let off aguero for gw15

That is the experience of playing EPL for long. https://t.co/tnhbOF9Y9w

@chelseafc Adi Greatest!!!

#Chelsea #Hazard #Willian #Costa 
Blessed
####################
@cufcblues @ChelseaFC poor ref him pal surely the fa will ban fabregas for that
####################
@teddywills1805 Would say Costa but expecting him to drop somebody and get banned for a few games at some point
####################
@mark_v1 @ManCity potential last man foul on Aguero, the potential pen from the Cahill hand ball, potential hand ball from Costa
####################
FABREGAS BITCH-SLAPPED FERNANDINHO N STILL HAD HIM SENT OFF!!!!!!

WHAT A LEGEND!!!!!! @cesc4official
####################
Is Sergio Aguero not a bastard sha! after making the idiot captain of my Fantasy Team, score u no score, u come worst matter by getting RED
####################
@gopack7777 @NCSU_99_17_24 Aguero and Fernandinho. And the way both went down might mean multiple games
####################
No one's said anything about Fabregas giving Fernandinho a little slap before he starts pushing him
####################
Surprise if you can win the league when Kolarov still play for us. https://t.co/kVRmeTk9Jf
####################
9.45 - own goal by cahill.
10.30 - chelsea won 3-1 https://t.co/dsPF6nK6kA
####################
That was a statement by Chelsea. Great game! De Bruyne scores and it could have been completely different. Now it's rugby time...
####################
@bateson87 @KrisDaNorwegian pushed aguero to the floor after his tackle
####################
We are all ignoring the fact that a certain Mr Bravo = PIPE......
####################
Nice break for the holiday period https://t.co/rnVDMXhBkf
####################
Aguero's tantrum started this
####################
@darktheory if Costa was out for a significant period, that could be damaging
####################
Pussy like Aguero
####################
Fuck you for ever calling Claudio Bravo world class @Obidinho9
####################
Arsenal's fans should be celebrating!! no agueroo and no fernandinho.. lucky win.
####################
BRAVO SHOULD BE A DEFENDER DOESNT STAY IN NET
####################
Such useless Bravo
####################
For us result not perfect but it showed massive vulnerabilities in each side. also now aguero missed at least 3 games that's a boost
####################
@d_wareagle  Exactly! look how Fabregas pretended to be innocent.
####################
@samuelluckhurst yeah I'm not sure you can really justify what Aguero just did
####################
@anaIdirgeprat As good as Chelsea look, they are HUGELY reliant on Costa playing every game. This won't happen all season
####################
@BeardedRentboy respect to Fabregas but you sound really racist dude
####################
So angry at that tackle by Aguero he's dickhead
####################
Shittt I missed this https://t.co/AE8jqzbLuK
####################
Hope all my first XI play because Fernandinho will bring -1 to the #FPL party!
####################
As for Fernandinho I wouldn't want to bump into him in a dark ally he's well 'ard
####################
Manchester City 1-3 Chelsea
45' Cahill G. (Gol contra) (Manchester City)
60' Diego Costa (Chelsea)
70' Willian... https://t.co/dYzdGob5JY
####################
What. A. Win. Costa &amp; Hazard sublime. Aguero showed his dark side again. City completely lost their heads. #CFC #KTBFFH
####################
Aguero probably retaliated because he's sick of bottling big games and only scoring against relegation candidates
####################
Jose kicked a bottle. Aguero kicked a player. Pep mocked the referee. Need to hear from you soon @FA.
####################
@P0GBOOM it was horrible
Deserved a red
Fernandinho was comical though
Started bitch slapping Cesc
####################
He still got it. Our midfield is crazy https://t.co/FIHEpIfW19
####################
Hahaha we just ended Man city. Sore losers https://t.co/qNnWL5o80F
####################
man city wer dealth at home hmmm seiously aguero need to learn how to behave
####################
"@Cartha_of_CFC: LMAO Fabregas helped Fer get sent off. Dude let him push him very well..." as in eh.. smart dude
####################
I used to think aguero was a fair player. Hang your head in shame @aguerosergiokun
####################
@MichaelWardle clinical. Costa was superb. How does it leave your cup match in moolah?
####################
@gazwillis100 absolute stupidity from Aguero! You can't defend!
####################
That little scrap between Fabregas n Fernandinho was more entertaining than Pacquiao v Mayweather
####################
So glad I resisted bringing Aguero into my #FPL team. Not quite so Re: Costa
####################
Bad challenge from aguero defo a red card disappointing end 2 the match
####################
Like. Diego Costa has gone EIGHT games without a yellow. Conte is really working magic. https://t.co/uvMb6iwRTW
####################
Yes the Argentinians love the Brazilians alright #aguero v #sideshowbob
####################
Fernandinho and aguero miss the arsenal game
####################
Didn't Aguero stick one on Luiz a few back?
####################
Fernandinho should have at least Hit Fabregas well. He fell for the trap
####################
Poor tackle from Aguero not like him at all but red was the correct colour
####################
Goals from Cahill,Willian,Costa and @hazardeden10 helps @ChelseaFc beat Man City 1-3 #MCICHE
####################
Fabregas is a shit bag, absolute weapon
####################
Aguero was so stupid tbh. Mug
####################
who was it that aguero assaulted that time like 3/4 years ago in the FA cup semi final
####################
That was a disgusting thing to do by Aguero at the end of a match that was done. Awful. It should be a 5 match ban.
####################
@fernandinho are u raging? Do you need some tissues?
####################
My fantasy team had three players in that game, Cahill, Fernandinho and Aguero as captain. Good stuff.
####################
Good week to put aguero as my captain.
####################
So whoever N'Golo Kante plays for wins the league? Is that how football works now?
####################
Ray Parlour @talkSPORT on the Aguero tackle: "It was horrendous. One of the worst I've seen for years." #MCFC #CFC

Aguero will miss the and against Liverpool??
Lmao thanks conte

####################
Kawgen banza kwagen hoppiShege hobbit kawai Aguero is a short fuck !
####################
Fabregas must have said something bad to Fernandinho. Good job maa man
####################
Actually it's 8 considering Cahill's own goal. https://t.co/oIaun0tuSY
####################
Fernandinho needs a significant ban. Off of a football pitch, that's assault. Needs to start being treated as such.
####################
Two things happened in this game... chlelsea took their chances and Bravo is just shut....
####################
Trashed them to an extent to lose their mind. What a bunch of crybabies city players are. Glad that fabregas kept his cool.
#KTBFFH
####################
Mancity never displayed a professional game especially aguero @nixxsnjeru @ni_rex @ChelseaFC
####################
Not the first time Aguero has done tackles like this, spitting his dummy out and going in like that is a disgrace. Should be a 6 month ban
####################
Love you @hazardeden10 https://t.co/JVm25hxjkt
####################
But really tho did bravo stop 1 single shot?
####################
I can see why Aguero was sent off, BUT Luiz should've been sent off in the first half and in a way, Aguero was just getting his own back...
####################
@bateson87 WTF???? Fernandinho slapped Fabregas......
####################
Aguero will be back for our match with city regardless. We need to spin them. Some1 give us a hyperbolic time chamber

####################
Aguero out of the Arsenal match. Lovely.
####################
That is absolutely disgusting by Aguero. Give him a 5 game ban minimum
####################
How did @cesc4official escape a red card ...he started it by giving fernandinho a sly slap round the face #MCICHE
####################
@paddypower cheeky slap from fabregas
####################
Frankly speaking, if Cahill hadn't scored an own goal, this would have been 3-0 win away at the Etihad #CFC #MCICHE
####################
If Costa did what Aguero just did, the Sun and Daily Mail would dedicate their whole back-page to calling for an 8 game ban.
####################
Thank God Costa was substituted before the Fight...
####################
Beautiful x https://t.co/A1FX1lJgVM
####################
Costa is better than Aguero, in all aspects.
####################
You can choose to believe what you want but Aguero is a dirty cunt and he's always been. Worse than Costa even
####################
Right. Who goes in for Aguero? Has to be Austin I think. Loads of spare money for Sanchez and maybe even an upgraded keeper! #FPL
####################
@Kieran_Dhadli ref did us dirty, and Cesc got a slap in on Fernandinho frustration got to us
####################
Whata cunt https://t.co/UahFTIDeHN
####################
So glad i put aguero as my captain :)
####################
Fabregas no saint there at the end here flicked fernandino in the face. Knew exactly what he was doing
####################
No like that's the first time aguero done that to Luiz horror that
####################
Fabregas is a right snidey twat isn't he? Top shit housing by the sneaky little Spaniard there!
####################
That's dirt from Aguero #MCICHE
####################
Great end for City https://t.co/IIffhxVJmK
####################
Always seems to be ignored but Aguero is one dirty little c***
####################
Aguero will miss two key games (Leicester &amp; Arsenal)
####################
@PeterFSH Aguero's was pretty bad as well tbf
####################
Thirst for glory by Aguero. Should have squared for his team mate on two occassions. Let his mates down today. Opportunity for Iheanacho
####################
@arseblog @FuciousMo aguero and fernandinho banned for arsenal game
####################
People letting a red card get in the way of the fact that Aguero did nothing in yet another big game.
####################
Are we not going to give Cahill credit?

For giving Man City Hope.
####################
@LT_34 I was tryna find out why Fernandinho was so mad, then saw Fabregas had gave him a cheeky little slap
####################
De Bruyne will rue his misses. Two very good chances to make it 2-0 before Chelseas comeback.
####################
#bbcfootball so glad I didn't transfer #aguero into my #FantasyFootball

@cesc4official you absolute fucking wet cunt .... state of getting that Fernandinho sent off! You fucking virgin !

Absolutely love it. Love it more that aguero is out for 3 games
####################
Sergio Aguero is sent off for a reckless challenge on David Luiz. Right decision. #CFC https://t.co/WiUCZ2D8eY

@TheSplinterCell @Greg_YNWA1 totally agree with this. Cahill makes rash and wrong decisions
####################
@cristianchigre @ManCityES @aguerosergiokun @fernandinho what do you said my dear friend chigre
####################
I swear i woulda dropped fernandinho if i was on that pitch bullying my guy fabregas
####################
That challenge from Aguero was horrible! #MCICHE
####################
Having enjoyed watching those last few minutes nothing changes my opinion of Fabregas, he's a snide cunt!
####################
If you're gonna get sent off for a 2 footed challenge on Luiz at least do his ACL or snap his shin whilst you're at it Aguero lad
####################
Willian took back his place from Pedro! https://t.co/5uMcE6fy7F
####################
Oh yeah the way pep aired Fabregas handshake was jokes
####################
Lmaoo. Nah. Fabregas has that barca arsenal blood. He must have said something.
####################
@DanMcfc10_ Fernandinho shocked me with that. Not like him at all. Proper disappointed
####################
Aguero with a reckless tackle, but Fernandinho being the scum that he is. Bother deservingly sent off. Iheanacho lucky to be on as well.
####################
What was Claudio Bravo's pass accuracy today please...anyone? Since that's what he was bought to come do &amp; not to make saves or clean sheets
####################
@LondonBluePod has to be chalobah for running over and getting at aguero...
####################
Aguero killed this match tbh
####################
Nice work #Arsenal Twitter on highlighting Aguero suspension!

@GNev2 Fabregas should've seen red too for the cheeky slap on Fernandino? Retrospective action? since poor ref missed dat too.  #cityvcfc

Probably the first game after his move where Kante hasnt been that good.

ALWAYS CAPTAIN AGUERO HAHA #FPL

@aguerosergiokun and @fernandinho are cunts

Aguero and fernandinho you are a fucking disgrace
####################
Fabregas always been a sly RAT !! Slapped Fernandinho in the face then shit himself.
####################
Aguero with a dirty one
####################
Aguero should get more than 3 match ban for that.It was a violent conduct. #MCICHE
####################
@TomCampbe11 Fernandinho could be longer than 3 games. Fantasy Managers will start panicking about Aguero's enforced absence.
####################
@RyanBaldiEFB I don't think this is true. There's about 8 players who can be unplayable. Sanchez, Coutinho, De Bruyne, Payet. All capable
####################
Aguero and Fernandinho. Absolutely disgusting. #MCICHE
####################
Horror tackle from #Aguero #MCICHE
####################
Fernandinho can hold that as well wasteman
####################
@KizzleKicks7 I think you'll be losing Fabregas to a ban too.
####################
Football is an emotional sport if you've played any competitive game you would know , can't vilify anyone other than Aguero there
####################
I trust my cool-headed guys De Bruyne and Aguero. They can't be involved in such a stupid brawl.
####################
@GradeAComics @TheHulksBigToe That's a 4 match ban for Aguero as well I think. That's a big loss.
####################
@BwfcGoals aye not disputing that but fabregas definitely made sure of it
####################
I concur https://t.co/hAMDYVYncT

Aguero should get 5 games for that. 

Awful.

@JamesWalsh9 Aguero what was he thinking!?
####################
Ok. It's decided. Kane in for Aguero next week. 
#FPLproblems
####################
Good thing Costa was on the bench

Tbh I think Aguero and Fernandinho just wanted Christmas off.

Aguero out and I vow not to bring him back in this season.
####################
Well that all escalated very quickly!
Disgraceful challenge from Aguero!
####################
De Bruyne doesn't miss those two again
####################
Fair play to fabregas for not reacting to being grabbed by the throat and pushed over a barrier
####################
I wish Aguero had broken Luiz's legs. Cant stand that Cunt.
####################
I've lost all respect I had for Aguero hope someone ends his career tbh he's a disgraceful human being
####################
@lala_cox Cesc is smart, he slapped him because he wanted the reaction, poor on Fernandinho to give in to the point of the shove
####################
People Captained Aguero...smh
####################
Hilarious from city there. And love that aguero has score minus points on fantasy premier league! #FPL #MCFCvCFC
####################
That little rat bastard Aguero went to purposely injure Luiz there. Pure scum. Should be banned for a lot more than 3 games.

Aguero and Fernandinho out of the Arsenal game on December 18
####################
If Costa were on the pitch during the scrap, someone would've bled.
####################
Aguero turned into Costa and Costa turned into Aguero this season. #fpl
####################
@Chiccywood honestly, much less bothered by the tackle by Aguero than Fernandinho zooming in from across the field &amp; flying off the handle.
####################
Fernandinho grabbed Fabregas' neck about 4 times before deciding that wasnt enough, and pushed him over an ad board.
####################
And for me, Fernandinho should get an extended ban. Hand to the throat of Fabregas not once, but twice.
####################
Horrible horrible club Chelsea and Costa is my most hated player in the league. Monkey looking cheat
####################
Shocking from Fernandinho https://t.co/JOI8Uwzkc2

Aguero just gave himself December off..

####################
I left after Hazard's goal and look at my twitter to find out it was WWE at the end smh
####################
And,  aguero fernandinho miss game arsenal..yeah
####################
That has to be a MINIMUM of 5 game bans for both aguero and Fernandinho. 4 isn't enough
####################
Diego Costa is getting buckets this season! Conte has the Blues motivated and that's a scary thing. https://t.co/eEQmi6sGsW

@Coopswords both weren't great today. Cahill definitely targeted and didn't get support

#CFC Final score City 1-3 Chelsea! What a second half from the Blue boys! As for Aguero on Luiz? Seen it before haven't we!!??
####################
Fernandinho should be banned for 7-8 matches

damn it, aguero got red.  kun to kane done!
####################
@abcdefatih @ChuBoi i think de bruyne missing an open goal was the difference
####################
What a game. Just how big a result that was could be seen at the end with Aguero and Fernandinho both seeing red. #MCFC 1 v 3 #CFC
####################
@jords_mac @RobbieSavage8 btw I certainly don't condone what aguero or Fernandinho did. They both deserve
####################
@BillyBy17 @StuBrennanMEN hey not his problem if fernandinho to stupid enough to get sucked in.
####################
Surely Fernandinho shld get 6 as well @FA
####################
Fabregas won the battle on the pitch but he let some poor shit cunt from Brazil half the player he ever was push him. Needs retribution

Fuck you Aguero. 
-6 in goal FPL

Terrible scenes at the end.... city players should be ashamed. Football is football and the better team won. Aguero, bad act from a pro
####################
City will be without aguero n fernandinho,their season looks over a bit
####################
@SnoopWoggg @NoLaughingMata he won't though his name ain't Diego Costa
####################
Man City play Liverpool at the end of the month so I'm gonna need the Aguero and Fernandinho bans to be 5 a piece minimum.
####################
Is there any evidence that Fab slapped Fernandinho? https://t.co/RLKXzKDs7C
####################
@Dazza1889 fernadinho getting himself sent off in solidarity with aguero was sweet
####################
@ara22t Can't say I agree with that all. Not sure why Fernandinho went after him, but Fabregas was restrained. Fernandinho was the dick.

@FA that's gotta be at least 5 game suspensions each for Aguero and Fernandinho. Disgraceful #MCICHE
####################
The tackle from Aguero reminded me of the tackles that went in when Liverpool John Moores played against Liverpool Uni. I loved those games!
####################
Clearly City could not handle that loss at home 
Great maturity by Chelsea players especially Fabregas
#CFC
####################
Aguero straight red. Awful challenge now suspended for three matches ugh
####################
Aguero better prepare to be out for awhile after that challenge. Definitely at least 4 games suspension.
####################
@bateson87 Pushed Aguero straight after the foul. Should have been sent off as well IMO
####################
@FantasyYIRMA Let's not forget that Aguero missed a hatful of chances in addition to his red card.An all around shafting for his #FPL owners
####################
@Daniel_Buckley_ Fabregas slapped him first though??
####################
Nothing gives more joy, than supporting Chelsea! This team this season,.... Ooops! Catch us if u can!!! Costa.. BEAST MOOD!!

####################
@chrisburford @danielclee17 very frustrating as you can imagine, De Bruyne scores that chance and it's near enough 3 pts such fine margins
####################
@natefc I'll take that aguero comes back lacking game time and no Fernandinho in the middle sounds good to me
####################
Aguero choosed the wrong game not to turn up
####################
Wonderful act. https://t.co/89vaSRaQVO
####################
And fernandinho..."@judy_that: Aguero will miss our match then"
####################
And Fabregas not reacting at all made Fernandinho look even worse.
####################
@fa need a match ban for aguero cause this isn't the first time he has done it on the same player
####################
@Chelsea_HQ aguero got sat down in so many different ways this match, it was amazing
####################
If Fernandinho doesn't get a longer ban I'm gonna be pissed. Coward.
####################
@oharaa Fabregas couldn't believe his luck at Fernandinho's idiocy.
####################
Can we say all Manchester teams always get 4 goals to 0 from Chelsea if we count the Own Goal from Cahill #MCICHE
####################
Aguero's a LIL BITCH
####################
Fernandinho should be charged by the FA. Unprofessional.
####################
Pep sold Joe Hart for the ball playing Bravo to concede anyhow
####################
Fabregas can be the ultimate wing man. Assists bi what???
####################
@bateson87 He shoved Aguero down after the tackle.
####################
Incredible that's Aguero's first ever red card. Loves a snidey/high/studs up foul.
####################
Who the fuck is Fernandinho? Twat
####################
@SimplyMemphxs The way Fabregas stood there and played victim. Wish Dino stamped on his head
####################
Fernandinho better get a ban cos if it were cost now the world will be saying shi
####################
Fernandinho knew who to chokoza bila any reaction. Nigga should've tried that shit na ndume nyeusi ndio ajue fruit salad haiwekangwi nyanya.
####################
Aguero messed up my FLP #MCICHE
####################
Fabregas just doesn't care enough. Whereas Pedro is shit.
####################
@bateson87 @KrisDaNorwegian he was the one who run over first and grabbed aguero
####################
I think everyone's fantasy football team just went to shit #Aguero
####################
@Ladbrokes is Costa 3-1 the correct scorecast.
####################
Fernandinho has no class at all. https://t.co/yTUFPb8hqA
####################
Aguero's tackle on Luiz one of the worst I've ever seen.
####################
The miss by De Bruyne was huge
####################
But Fernandinho, what a dirty prick
####################
Aguero I never expererit
####################
Aguero, as much as I like him, should be suspended for at least games for that disgusting challenge against David Luiz. #MCFC
####################
Aguero and Fernandinho about to chop proper bans just when the season is getting hot. Amazing stuff
####################
Chalobah putting Aguero in his place is probably my highlight of the weekend. Deserves #MOTM just for doing that.
####################
Fabregas na snake
####################
Aguero's high on David Luiz again!!! History repeating. Deserves a long ban https://t.co/1E8MuhtdCE
####################
City completely lost their heads there like should be lengthy bans for all involved thought fabregas should've walked too stupid behaviour
####################
I reckon they'll be busy banning half your team... https://t.co/n4rXPu3cFi
####################
Aguero should be out for at least 5 weeks
####################
Retweeted Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC):

What a turnaround that was! Trailing at the break, goals from Diego Costa,... https://t.co/dzdwe7sf5C
####################
There will be a few more players missing games after that MC blowup. https://t.co/lry0FuWbJf
####################
Thank god Costa wasn't in that scrum cuz he might've killed a few of those city cunts.
####################
@thegingerwig @BMRisingTV am I the only one who has no confidence in Bravo one on one?
####################
Aguero has just single handedly ruined city's title hopes for me but we shall see
####################
What a cracking game! Costa is a game changer
####################
@TGrefstad I didn't watch the game but heard Luiz could've been sent off for a foul on Aguero earlier, still stupid from Aguero
####################
I don't blame Aguero, at some point he was going to get back at Luiz after Taylor bottled the decision in the first half
####################
Fabregas must chop suspension sha
####################
Was a bit scared with Cesc starting but he proved his mettle. Also immense in that stand-off with Fernandinho
####################
poke @tbclmn @Seb_lensois https://t.co/plVyCvrCXc
####################
Fair play to Fabregas for not smacking Fernandinho. Very professional.
####################
Let's see if City will get punished for Fernandinho basically doing WWE on Cesc
####################
Aguero 8 games ban. Make it happen
####################
Should give one fucking hard punch to aguero and leave etihad as a winner. Gonna get amazing red card achievement. #MCICHE #GaryJCahill
####################
Going straight to the #fpl to get rid of Aguero. |-O
####################
Cesc was ready to have a go at Fernandinho but held his calm. Class, class person.
####################
@Subhash_ati9 true that, ref didnt bottle it while sending aguero off..shows mike dean bottled it on the luiz challenge against Utd
####################
People will say Fabregas did well not to react but the Truth is he didnt want none of it lol
####################
who did Fernandinho push over the barrier???
####################
@MLong94 Luiz's challenge first half. Fabregas slap. Chalaboah barge.
####################
Look trouble run away "@jag_bros: Fabregas was very MATURE there ...."
####################
Fabregas should have a red too for slapping Fernandinho around the chops! #moreredsthebetter!
####################
Fabregas is a Cunt. He slapped Fernandinho first.
####################
Willian should be starting ahead of Pedro.
####################
*checks fixture list*

That Aguero tackle was assault, right? 3 game ban not enough, right? Err, 5 game ban should suffice, right? RIGHT?
####################
@blamefulpurse20 @MrGeorgeBenson how he just stood there When Fernandinho pushed him and grabbed him around the neck
####################
What a game that was amazing City will be kicking themselves though could have been 3-0 before Costa scored #cityvcfc
####################
@JaydenDarcy13 yeah bullshit that Fabregas only got a yellow
####################
Got Aguero in your fantasy team ?? Oh dear !! #superblues
####################
That second half was absolutely magnificent - one of the best away 'big game' performances I've seen. Costa ludicrously good. #CFC

Good news for City as Aguero gets sent off. He'll miss their next couple of games, wouldn't want to be playing them soon.
####################
Aguero thanks for getting sent off mate. Fuck Chelsea.
####################
City loss the game and losses their head too #fuckshit two red cards 
Fernandinho deserve red cards after what he doing Respect for Fabregas
####################
AGUERO BOTTLING IT IN BIG GAMES MY DRUGGGG
####################
City losing the plot at the end doesn't bode well for them , poor challenge from aguero deserves to miss 3 games
####################
... @cesc4official pass to Costa wow!!!!!!!!!! That was the motivation
####################
@bateson87 pushed cunt aguero
####################
Looks like Fabregas actually slapped Fernandinho first and made the most of Fernandinho's push by tumbling over the boards into the crowd.
####################
@Deshysmalls after slapping Fernandinho first ?
####################
Aguero's a cunt. Chelsea are different gravy. The sun is hot.
####################
I'm not a fan of Aguero after what he just did to Luiz. Unsportsmanlike
####################
@SRMoodie7 @MessiMinutes "thug" ya ok. Cesc initiated, slapped him and said likely said somethin bad. But Fernandinho the thug
####################
#MCFCvCFC what a dreadful tackle by #aguero . Total disrespect for a players safety.  Shame he'll only get a 3 game ban.
####################
De bruyne taking the biggest L of his career
####################
Hazard can't be ur favorite person rn https://t.co/4ZRC8XhTa5
####################
@bateson87 i have a untradeable IF D costa, which formation best suits him. Tried him as lone striker, but feels too slow? what do you say?
####################
Aguero should be suspended more than 3 games
####################
4goals included the own goal by cahill lol
####################
@LondonBluePod I'd also like to put a vote in for Chalobah for putting Aguero on his ass where he deserves to be
####################
Cheers Aguero captained the cunt up and he gets sent off
####################
Oh dear. City lost it. I really like Aguero but that was cowardly.
####################
@bateson87 @KrisDaNorwegian he floored aguero
####################
Doesn't like Luiz, Aguero, does he? That's 2 nasty ones he's left in him.
####################
There was an Aguero Luis challenge even the last time when Luis was in PL. Horrendous challenge today though.
####################
Proper nasty little bastard aguero
####################
Who doesn't hate losing doe... bad from Aguero but Fernandinho, Chabaloha (sp), Fabregas, Iheanacho were appalling
####################
Maybe nasty piece of work too strong but this was Aguero on Luiz four years ago. https://t.co/BGv5HHujMI
####################
Fernandinho is a bully. Disgraceful. https://t.co/SfplIg5tQK
####################
Good for Gunners https://t.co/GlkkxdCRcB

Aguero at least should get a 3 match ban and fernandhino at least 2. Surely!
####################
@bateson87 @KrisDaNorwegian  he pushed Aguero over
####################
Aguero is a very dirty player, Pep is still a snake and Costa is the best cf in EPL, maybe the world

So many strange things happened in that game, I'm not surprised by the ending. No Aguero or Fernandinho for AFC game should be a plus.
####################
@THEE_EBOS lol facts bro. We're too dangerous. Aguero really tried to break DavId Luiz tho. I'm hot
####################
wtf was that from aguero?!?
####################
Fabregas and some players from both ends should be ban after FA's review.
####################
@KarimB92 But then their only goal was a help by Cahill
####################
Aguero's "tackle" is so much worse than violent conduct, if that was Costa we'd be going crazy. It's an attempt to injure. It's disgusting.
####################
I now hate Aguero
####################
Aguero will be alright when he goes back to stat padding against teams like Burnley
####################
You're still shit Cahill
####################
At least Hazard scored #FPL
####################
Elite mentality from Cesc to stand amidst all the chokes and slaps. Got Fernandinho sent off properly.

And aguero the dirt bird

Fernandinho could face a ban similar to that of Dembele's right?

Great result, should have been out of it by the time we scored but brilliant counter attacking. Aguero shocker of a tackle.

No Aguero or Fernandinho against us, we have to get the 3 points

The nature of the aguero challenge is to hurt the player. That needs an extra punishment for me.
####################
@AhsanNaeem Fuck off was to Aguero btw.
####################
That was stupid from Aguero. He is a top professional player and should know better.

So a misconduct charge for pep and a lengthy ban for aguero to come? Come on chelsea great win

@lewiswarby bravo as a shot stopper is terrible, looks like an u12 goalkeeper

Wait what? I missed the whole Aguero thing!

Seeing lots of videos of Aguero vs Luiz from previous seasons. The hatred between them two is real.

2 Red Cards for Man City, Luiz and Fabregas were done bogus as fuck.

Wouldn't like to be Kevin De Bruyne right now. #MCICHE

Wont blame Aguero a BIT. He was continuously booted by Luiz throughout the game. Dont forget, Luiz didnt even had to be on the pitch.

8 wins in a row.. Yeah @ChelseaFC don't need a lot of chances to score as #PepGuardiola.. https://t.co/urbSFGvjzI
####################
I still stand on my grounds... Hart is a far better keeper than Bravo...
####################
@JoeBeecham Aguero should have a very long ban for that. Could have ended Luiz's career with that tackle
####################
Bravo is a disaster of a goalie.
####################
Chalobah ready to kill Aguero yo!
####################
Embarrassing end to an otherwise great game. City &amp; Guardiola outdone by Chelsea's quick counter attacks. Aguero &amp; Fernandinho sent off.
####################
Tensions were high at the end of Man City-Chelsea.

Sergio Aguero &amp; Fernandinho were both sent off. WATCH: https://t.co/h4gLLLRhdw (US only)
####################
@SantCazorIa Aguero two footing David Luiz. Iheanacho going at Batshuayi. Fernandinho pushing Cesc over.
####################
Aguero will miss Arsenal game. 

Time for Arsene Wenger to beat Pep. Let us expose the fraud more.
####################
Retro bans for Aguero and Fernandinho are a must. Terrible stuff. Wouldn't be surprised if nothing happens. They aren't the usual targets
####################
Fernandinho trying to calm Fabregas down,then he chose to chat shit...Cesc found himself in the stands,Lmaooo so satisfying!
####################
We need to Dab on 'em https://t.co/IB8PfHoTFI
####################
So after condemning him 2wks ago, he's  now better on the ball than pedro. Issss alright. https://t.co/L9423SPFUT
####################
I hope them reduce Fernandinho ban based on provocation from Cesc. https://t.co/Yua1BIzPM7
####################
His changes killed city tbh https://t.co/myOWN6cerJ
####################
I hope Aguero gets banned for at least 10 games for that tackle. Fucking disgusting, should be ashamed of himself
####################
@ChelseaFC should get fined for his disgusting behaviour. Hats off to Fabregas for keeping a cool head
####################
@OleOleCheIsea nd we won't solely miss Costa. We have easy games this december
####################
@Terrier1987cas he was looking behind him and heading to the boarding and made the most of it. Fernandinho shouldnt grab his neck but still
####################
#MCICHE @ChelseaFC  Congratulations to Costa, Willan, Hazard and the boys for a terrific match! I would like to thank Mr. Conte too!
####################
Condolences to people who captained him in FPL this week :D https://t.co/H3FiuzIfd6
####################
Aguero got both balls in my opinion. Never a red #CFC #MCFC #PrayForLuiz
####################
Costa: Calm guy today, didn't get in fights, scored and assisted.

Aguero: Scum meaningless tackle + red card
 
#MCICHE
####################
Bravo had to come out so make the it harder for hazard and willian to score. I still dont like bravo... hart i miss you #MCICHE
####################
Proper Sunday league tackle from Aguero!

What a turnaround that was! Trailing at the break, goals from Diego Costa, sub Willian and Hazard secure a great 3-1 win. #MCICHE

Aguero got his revenge for the challenge earlier in the match #CmonCity #MCICHE

That Aguero challenge is genuinely one of the worst I've ever seen.

Despite that, well done for Aguero and Fernandinho for getting red carded for the game against us

@GadSaad I'm not sure Bravo has fit in too well with City, but the defense on those counters was useless.

One of the worst "challenges" I've ever seen from Aguero. Disgusting behaviour from Fernandinho too. 

Imagine if it were Fellaini &amp; Rooney
####################
@OfficialFPL even tho' Aguero was the favorite on paper for this gameweek, I kept my faith in Costa and he came through with 9 neat points.

Cesc just had to stand there getting bullied by Fernandinho. Coward

Happy Costa wasn't on the pitch when Aguero killed Luiz. It would have ended differently.

i just want to argue with you .. Kun does kick way nuff b https://t.co/HDYAh38tr8
####################
Mad how all that could have been avoided if Aguero made the *got the ball* gesture.
####################
Interesting to see what happens with Aguero. Not a normal red. Only 3 for Shawcross and co, though,so maybe just a 1-match ban after all
####################
Fernandinho and Aguero to miss the arsenal game god is good
####################
Btw, Diego Costa now has as many goals with Chelsea as he did with Atletico in 27 less appearances &amp; a year &amp; a half shorter time.
####################
@jasoncundy05  Disgraceful tackle from Aguero. Two players sent off. Fans fighting with Chelsea players and stewards. Classy stuff from City
####################
Fabregas really kept his cool..am very sure on another day he would av retaliated
####################
Can you imagine the ban that Someone like Costa would get for that challenge? #Aguero
####################
At least we found out that Aguero is a low key cunt
####################
The good news Aguero and Fernandinho will miss the game against us. Sweet

@strebby1 I think he will for the awful tackle aswell as Fernandinho

Such a satisfying game of football. Riding luck. Comeback win away at title challengers. Get 2 of them sent off. Not have Aguero in FPL.
####################
Fabregas moving washed isn't his fault, it's the Arsenal in him
####################
@alexlebl23 @SalCornetta @jreidchapman time to start looking at fantasy replacements for Aguero, then
####################
@dayoo14 or Rooney or anyone else. Certain people get hammered far more than others. Costa is one for sure. Aguero done is loads of times
####################
Really have no idea what to make of that, lost for words, and now City are without Aguero and Fernandinho for the next few encounters - God
####################
@shipwreckflo with that kind of pass that he gave Costa? Izz not possible, fam.
####################
@Jadinho97 @Andeezy___ miles better is very forced. Costa is a different breed of striker imo
####################
My hate for Bravo continues, such a shit keeper. #BRINGBACKHART

Otamendi and Bravo should never see their names on a city team sheet ever again, both jokes
####################
'I'm not drinking my coffee out a cardboard cup. I like my coffee in a real cup thanks very much.' ..that a no to drive thru costa then mum?
####################
Red lost his head for the Ferna red. No arguments for Aguero and he should be bollocked for that

We will smash them. https://t.co/mlhoqExdht

We got Leicester,, Arsenal and Liverpool to play this month and Aguero gets a straight red for stupidity.

So glad I resisted bringing Aguero into my #FPL team. Not quite so re: Costa #MCICHE
####################
@nickabbo it's true. He's not even your best player. Costa makes all the difference. An injury to him and you're absolutely fucked.

Costa goal. Hazard goal..Willian goal. 

Ha. Chelsea fan's dream day.

8 wins in a row! 

Go @ChelseaFC #KTBFFH

After all that, City end the match with two red cards. Hilarious. Even funnier that bans for Aguero/Fernandinho will follow.
####################
Aguero should get a 4 match ban tho.
####################
Well, well , well @diegocosta proved me wrong, chose Aguero for captain as I thought he was less likely to be sent off. #bbcfootball

Aguero and Fernandino were rightly sent off, but Anthony Taylor is not a real referee he was so bad today.

@DrChubbyy Its cool sha, not my team. Just my honest assessment. Chelsea were played off the park. Aguero and De Bruyne were god awful

Aguero, otamendi and bravo all proper shit today, aguero can be excused because of his past but not the other two.
####################
@ThiagoSilva__3 lol or clever? He didn't retaliate and Fernandinho gets sent off, simple
####################
Also, I'm quite happy Fernandinho is suspended. He's the 1st player I'd take out of the City lineup if I were to weaken it.

We scored 4 goals. To hell with haters. City could not even score 1. Nansins. The score is there for ur lukin. #hazard #chelsea

Shit that from Aguero. Cutting rough with 30secs left and trying to "do" someone is a shithouse game.

@garyalsmith yes you will . And if Suarez made a tackle like aguero he would get a 6 match ban

####################
@cjnorris that foul from Aguero was vile...hope he gets a loooooong ban
####################
Fabregas slaps Fernandinho hence why he gets all aggy. He gets away with it of course.
####################
Run in? He grabbed him by the neck aggressively and pushed him several times! Go to spec savers you sore losers! https://t.co/Pwpa0lluTG
####################
Well Shitty actually beat themselves there, poor finishing, poor discipline, 
The better side but can't defend for toffee,and Bravo no words
####################
Love this one ahahha look at ivan at the end ahahah https://t.co/n67KoAcwer
####################
@aimeeIeigh Fabregas was just talking it because he's a boss
####################
Aguero should be banned for 3 months not three matches for that challenge
####################
There is nothing more important nor exciting in football as pace, which is why I enjoyed Willian and, particularly, Hazard's goals so much
####################
@ClassyGylfi aguero should be 5 fernandiho maybe 3
####################
5 match ban for Aguero if u ask me
####################
Nice lad that Aguero really. Probably slipped like he did when he elbowed Reid.
####################
What Aguero did was unpardonable. For a footballer of such gift, it was shameful. #MCICHE
####################
Costa a changed man https://t.co/0chS2LmZQQ

Diego Costa comes off injured against Man City after suddenly going down https://t.co/3hllQ7wukh via @Metro_Sport
####################
@RahatRMCF A clincial Aguero would have been a big help
####################
@Knox_Harrington Fabregas was magnificent in getting Fernandinho sent. That's world class snidery that.
####################
It's good to be Blue! #Chelsea https://t.co/sjI7jdPK3b
####################
Disgusting tackle by Aguero. #MCICHE
####################
Smh, aguero por a letterlijk kaba luiz eu football career ke tackle ey, emotional ass
####################
Love that https://t.co/i5zQ9BA8bc
####################
@fernandinho you knob
####################
In WWE, they call it face-turn. Aguero &amp; Fernandinho are top heels of the EPL from today. #MCICHE
####################
I mean they tried to press, and so many times Silva and De Bruyne picked the gaps. It was really just very bad finishing from City
####################
Aguero, once a complete arsehole, always a complete arsehole. https://t.co/7X2CS2wCZH
####################
Aguero is as dirty as they can be.... disgraceful behavior! Guardiola sons!!! #MCICHE
####################
FPL isn't happening for me, I use my wildcard and Aguero gets sent off and Cahill scored an own goal
####################
Aguero will surely be banned for that tackle. Career ender.
####################
De bruyne is not gonna be able to sleep after that, missed open goal to lose 3 points unlucky belgian buddy
####################
Blue Heaven --Royal Blue Heaven #CFC #MCICHE https://t.co/S2Lt669t2z
####################
Just saying ref was absolute shit. Fabregas slapped Fernandinho and in the game he was pure wank. #cityvcfc
####################
Gary Cahill Goal Manchester City vs Chelsea 1-0 .. Premier League England .. 03-12-2016 https://t.co/rEiOINFRmi
####################
Hope they add that tackle by aguero into the next FIFA
####################
@KarimAlkhoja haha "the other Fernandinho" meant Fernandinho lmao
####################
Fernandinho as well disgraceful https://t.co/z6bO8l2Ci9
####################
@MessiMinutes He slapped Fernandinho and stood back. Antagonizing prick!
####################
Aguero is a disgrace, what a knob.
####################
@ManCity bravo out , joe in
####################
@MessiMinutes exactly, Fabregas is a dirty sly bastard but still can't react like that but it must have been something he said
####################
@GNev2 a bit of balance would be nice.  Cesc clearly slaps Fernandinho.  Didn't hear Sky mention that?!
####################
@AyniElmi looks like Aguero will be out for 4 games
####################
Costa 7 of the Biggest Dating Fails Ever
https://t.co/urnF2DadkS
####################
There's my respect gone for Guardiola and Aguero. Disgusting ad losing pieces of shit
####################
That aguero challenge was BEAUTIFUL
####################
Don't give me heart attack like that every week tho. It's a little scary https://t.co/ksZciuAM8G
####################
Fabregas is the sneakiness person in the league. Slapped Fernandinho, got him to react, then flung himself over the advertising board
####################
@MCFClnfo again Bravo must work on his right side. Why not use your feet
####################
"You lot beat them before they got cranking"
Perhaps we just beat them n Costa's goal flattered them? We controlled them for 75 min, no?
####################
Hahhaaha Another Disaster to Them.... https://t.co/P71ih516Df
####################
If aguero decides to disappoint. He does it big.
####################
What would provoke such a reaction from Fernandinho... I don't trust Fabregas
####################
@_IKENNA_ Aguero is facing a 4 game suspension
####################
Antonio Conte shouted on major general kante, and he delivered a perfectly pass to hazard who turned and found costa, and it was a goal#chel
####################
Yes Chelsea were clinical, but isn't Bravo a really shit keeper?
####################
When was the last time Diego Costa got a yellow card?
####################
Aguero just will be back for the game against us
####################
Aguero is a stupid prick aswell
####################
Sometimes you need luck in football, had De Bruyne scored from 3yards, game would have been different. Chelsea were superb though.
####################
Huge win for Chelsea , how will City respond now especially as Aguero will be suspended and also  trip to Anfield on Dec 31st #LFC
####################
Referee was piss poor but even still should off been out of sight. Bravo is dogshit.
####################
Diego Costa easily the man of the match
####################
Diego Costa was a didier drogba'ed today....#EPL
####################
Hazard to win player of the year
####################
Fernandinho is lucky he's playing in this era of football, if he played against the likes of Roy Keane, expect a broken leg next time lol
####################
He slapped Fernandinho first you idiot.. https://t.co/jix6QT3QSY
####################
Can win any way they like on the front foot or counter attack. Fernandinho was a disgrace
####################
I think the world has figured out how to win the league on England. Just sign Kante!  #cfc
####################
Our defence's quite good except cahill. Man. City can't scoring even once. Solid! #BlueDay
####################
What aguero did was dumb but what fernandinho did was unacceptable that was stupid af
####################
No defenders have dealt with Costa like Kos and mustafi but nothing was said
####################
@Yullaw10 I'm glad I didn't trust Aguero! @OfficialFPL
####################
Costa has become a good boy.
####################
WHAT IS MAN DOING.
also love how fabregas doesn't react in the slightest looooool https://t.co/pGXn75CKvg
####################
@JayPhilips1075 and how did cesc not punch Fernandinho in the mouth when he is grabbing him by the throat?
####################
Fernandino Choke Slams Fabregas to the ground #ManCityvsChelsea @AlexParisHylton https://t.co/w7lll06RX8
####################
Fernandinho has to get a 7 match ban atleast
####################
Sure Chelsea rode their luck but ManCity self destructed in the end. Ceac should have seen red too for slapping Fernandinho.
####################
Aguero back for #LFC game.. our fucking luck
####################
Well done @mbatshuayi for standing up to that moron Fernandinho @fernandinho https://t.co/KoSiJjDJsL
####################
Fabregas just loves Arsenal, said something which made Fernandinho reacted to the point he received a red. Banned for #afc game.
####################
Once a great club, now riddled with spoilt brats. Aguero and Fernandinho should be banned for a long, long time #MCICHE
####################
That should have been three red cards. #Fabregas
####################
Lol can't really fuck a man up that isn't fighting you back. You just end up looking silly. https://t.co/zIadu6GVBC
####################
Won't argue for Costa's edgy play, but that's two footed lunge into Luis' leg. Can't defend that. @AndersonLance @trolleyLAMB @evilbluebird
####################
@bensmith130 no, re watch it, it was Cesc who slapped the other,  when fernandinho was trying to solve,
####################
@BBCSport @BBCRedButton FA should suspend fernandinho for a long time
####################
@CriminalCosta Aguero was out of hand. Then Fernandinho pushing fabregas over the boards. Out of hand.
####################
Even Cahill's goal was relevant...It changed the game!!!
####################
Aguero getting sent off just proves he's a cunt. He isn't even as good as people say. Penalty merchant.
####################
No he didn't he just shit himself mate https://t.co/3bJPZZas1x
####################
@OllieHolt22 Frustrations boil over after inept refereeing performance and wouldn't be surprised to see Fabregas get retro red for slap.
####################
Aguero has always been a dirty player, remember a few years ago when he went WWE on David Luiz's ass (literally) https://t.co/TMV3U8JupJ
####################
@_The12thMan Fernandinho and Aguero are two vital players for City. The  lack of maturity shown by both is mad.
####################
Costa Man of the Match well deserved
####################
Aguero is the best striker in England, stats will show you this everyday of the week.
####################
Fabregas got more assist in today's game than Ozil has got this season in the PL.
####################
Take it Sergio don't like Luiz ? https://t.co/2omlsgny3r
####################
Any chance he gets 5 @FA ? https://t.co/G95ZdiKo5k
####################
Love Chalobah's reaction to Aguero. Fighting for the Chelsea shirt. That's what's it's all about #CFC
####################
Fernandinho is a little crap
####################
Fabregas slapped first, he played him https://t.co/EXYJVV3DAK
####################
FA's ruling on Aguero's tackle will say more about the FA than about Aguero.
####################
Aguero &amp; Fernandinho should be getting longer than 2 match bans for that
####################
Bravo, Otamendi, Kolarov, CLICHY!!! When will they be replaced? The later three are clearly not good enough and have been for the last year!
####################
What a DUMMY GOAL by Cahill to give City false hope.
####################
Did you captain aguero? https://t.co/wtpqJzi7ZC
####################
Aguero is so overrated.
####################
Aguero is a bitch though
####################
At least he gets a Xmas break though! https://t.co/w4xTb7wqPs
####################
Who tf is hazard pls
####################
'Not that type of player' https://t.co/LuUcjiyz2w
####################
City once again getting exactly what they deserve for not only employing Navas, but starting him.
####################
City v Chelsea was a bit like the movie Sliding Doors. If De Bruyne hadn't hit the bar, Aguero wouldn't have cheated on Gwyneth Paltrow.
####################
Aguero's ban doesn't matter, he's due to be out with an injury around now anyway
####################
To be fair, Fabregas gave him a nice klap to start it. https://t.co/KUbo2IMx24
####################
It takes some fantasy football talent to captain Couthino (injured before half time) then Aguero (sent off) in successive weeks! #mare :(
####################
@steveganye Costa is injured...
####################
If only Costa took part in that scrap...
####################
Costa would have gotten a lifelong ban https://t.co/qoAOCdbwmF
####################
Fernandinho also sees red at the end of the game and will miss the game against Arsenal #MCICHE
####################
@_ClinicalCosta no too much mistakes Otamendi and bravo being spastics Aguero and KDB bottling ez chances I'm actually fuming
####################
Claudio Bravo does nothing for city.
####################
Aguero shouldn't have done that but it never gets to that point if the game is called competently from the start.
####################
Did you back our top picks Costa and Alonso this weekend? Off to a flyer if you did #fandueltips
####################
Aguerro can't have any complaints.. Neither can Fernandinho.. Thought the ref was excellent..
####################
LMAOOO.. The control yooo https://t.co/qnH5ZtHUtp
####################
I do want to know what Fabregas said to make Ferna react like that mind
####################
Looool. Think so https://t.co/Jgc4ol8eUx
####################
Up side about this is that Aguero an Fernandinho are both suspended for City-Arsenal in 2 weeks
####################
@Daniel_kidd7 started on fabregas I believe
####################
Fernandinho is a hooligan. Lost respect for him. Spare of the moment thing, but this is a professional level. Much respect to Fabregas
####################
@brycie11 de Broune (shit spelling) missed and open net for 2 nill.  Then Costa woke up and won it for them.
####################
Well executed...Alonso also taking part https://t.co/qjdTdKjsrs
####################
Excellent game between Chelsea and City. Great intensity, too much in the end. De Bruyne will be hurting! Hit the Crossbar! #Rickamania
####################
So can we now start saying that Aguero is that type of player?
####################
@MELBEEEEEEEEN woah but costa and hazard really feeling it.
####################
#ManCityvsChelsea Fabregas slapped a player and then dived over the advertising boards. He should of got red as well.
####################
@VennOputa costa go too beat am...
####################
Kante is a born champion. https://t.co/MMuxflsZGT
####################
Aguero has definitely gone up in my estimations after that. Also seeing fabregas be bullied was pretty funny
####################
@DannyDowling91_ see Fernandinho? The look on fabregas face. Hahaha
####################
Now say so ya https://t.co/vdFBhx9Nc8
####################
In Guardiola's defence it's the players to blame for that. He got it spot on. If De Bruyne scores that sitter it's 2-0 and they ease
####################
@bateson87 Aguero wasn't getting golden boot regardless with that shit finishing.
####################
Absolute disgrace @aguerosergiokun https://t.co/OocxIulwb6
####################
That's pathetic from Aguero &amp; Fernandinho. We took our L like men &amp; left it at that. What are you fighting for?
####################
Huge Bans awaiting for Aguero and Fernandinho. Man City in trouble.
####################
Disgusting from city, my kids had to witness that act of thuggery. @FA @fernandinho
####################
Fabregas did well not to react there
####################
I don't know what it is about Luiz that brings out the nasty in Aguero.
####################
Fabregas slap Fernandenhu on the face first...! @richardajkeys #ManCityvsChelsea
####################
@UnitedFanAcc Fabregas slapped him first lol
####################
@RealSshawn Kun fly kick David Luiz and Fernandinho chuck Fabregas
####################
Conte is a legend. Smashed City at ETIHAD with Fabregas in the starting 11. Unreal!
####################
Aguero definitely deserves a lengthy ban for that shit, that was just horrendous.
####################
A good thing Costa come off cause me know that would be a red for him !
####################
I have to say - Fabregas in the last 30 minutes was outstanding. I thought his legs had gone. Clearly not.
####################
@deb_ayy hazard extra bae this season and Costa lowkey trying to want me to love him now the way he's been playing
####################
#MCICHE shitty cunt fabregas must have said something racist to fernandinho to get him so riled up. Fucking hate Chelsea. Lucky win
####################
@UltimateLale wooh, I'm not a City fan. I'm a Utd fan.. I would just really like to sit on De Bruyne's face, nje
####################
@MLNXCreative Aguero nearly snapped him in half. A bit different
####################
Costa, Hazard and Willian. #CFC https://t.co/AaVTBOsIdD
####################
Aguero has declined man this hurts
####################
Eden hazard you fucking beauty.
Great way too start.
#CHEMCI 
#fpl
####################
@TheLeftWingBack de bruyne had an absolute nightmare probably the worst I've seen him.. and ref didn't help at all but we're to blame
####################
@NeagIe yep, Aguero flying two footed challenge and Fernandinho choked FABREGAS and threw him over the advertising board
####################
So aguero and Fernandinho going to miss 3 games? hahaha!!
####################
@Oscarholic Aguero should be banned from football, he almost chopped his leg off wtf
####################
Aguero and Fernan both 3 games?
####################
Fair to say I don't think Aguero likes Luiz https://t.co/UAWLkhRDhm
####################
Still relevant. https://t.co/McXDjC80D4
####################
Hold an L like him in the long run too https://t.co/MwSnBUKkt9

@ESPNSteinLine Not sure about outplayed. De Bruyne missed twice, all by himself, the 2-0
####################
SERGIO AGUERO'S HORRFIC TACKLE ON DAVID LUIZ SENT OFF RED CARD: https://t.co/w8CIn2VYnk via @YouTube
####################
Haha Cesc is a twat though,  slapped fernandinho then put on a baby face..  Haha
####################
No Aguero or Fernandinho for 3 games we've ruined Manchester City.
####################
@mcourtjennings @ManCity should have put that game away. De bruyne had an easy goal that he pooched.
####################
@fitzmcmuffin Could be more than 3 games for Aguero even
####################
@James_Dart It doesn't get much worse than that. Aguero also patted Cahill on the head in goading fashion after his OG. Poor day for him.
####################
Bailed Cahill out again.
####################
@markb_59 he barely pushed him are you mad ? Fabregas played it very well too
####################
Fabregas is such a wind up merchant! He slaps Fernandinho in the face then waits for him to react and get sent off! He was looking for it
####################
What a result for Chelsea. Major statement. They're also very good to watch, especially with Costa in this form. Man City meltdown v telling
####################
Aguero and luiz always having a problem
####################
dat me wah see from me baller dem https://t.co/08jUBSaRWb
####################
"Involving both sets of players"..... yeah, because your classless squad began assaulting the other team https://t.co/M20t7ATEaS
####################
A huge statement of intent from a rampant and ruthless Chelsea. Costa in beast mode. #CFC #MCFCvCFC
####################
@MisterpaulW I suppose if there is a weakness, very dependent on Costa if he were to miss games.  But no doubt have to be the favorites.
####################
enough madness in the last few mins to suggest @ManCity title challenge is over? No Aguero goals for the next 3 games... #MCFCvCFC
####################
Man of the match COSTA
####################
@StewieCricket HHahah yeah fabregas showed that !!!
####################
Him shoulda shot him a box. https://t.co/kSpR9arJX2
####################
#BrianPallister spends nearly 1 in 5 days of his time in Costa... https://t.co/czDHuBRcVY
####################
@arsenal_dub glad Aguero and Fernandinho won't be playing
####################
Diego Costa is marvelous,best striker in the PL
####################
Otamendi and bravo can fuck off both wastes of space. Guy saves nothing and the other cunt can't defend.
####################
In a match with 11 #Chelsea players on the pitch, who'd have bet on Sergio Aguero being the one to commit a heinous crime? #MCFC #CFC
####################
@RobackBen think it was Chalobah's push that sent them over edge. Credit to Fernandinho for trying to fight his own stewards.
####################
Get punish from who? Pep ass licking @fa? https://t.co/giGCDfoZba
####################
Hahah Fernandinho then the dafty
####################
All being said, CFC need Terry or Zouma back ASAP. Cahill is not an elite Premier League defender.. not even close. I've said it all season
####################
A rare photo of Diego Costa ejaculating on top of the table https://t.co/PxIXNKYuo1
####################
@McBerisso I think Chelsea without Costa would be completely different side, don't think ye would cope
####################
@ChelseaFC We are dominant! We are Chelsea! We are top of the League! Nuff said. Hope David Luiz and Diego Costa heal up for next weekend!
####################
well Aguero will get more than a 3 match ban already had one of them this season
####################
Lmao kolarov saw hazard running to that pass and was like https://t.co/7rT4vbkDRq
####################
Chalobah putting Aguero in his place is probably my highlight of the weekend. Deserves #MOTM just for doing that.
####################
mad props to fabregas for keeping his cool, glad fernandinho got sent off for that
####################
End of the day, Aguero is a shagger!
####################
Chalobah should've also had a striaght red for flooring Aguero right after the tackle.
####################
Give Aguero and Fernandinho a 12 match ban. Disgusting behaviour! @FA
####################
That Aguero tackle was absolutely awful! Like Neville said, it doesn't matter about the rules, Chalobah was right to defend his teammate
####################
Arsenal will beat City easily. Haven't lost to them in 3 years people forget that and they'll miss Fernandinho
####################
That One from Fernandinho ..... He should be banned at least  a couple of matches.. Total Disgrace
####################
Fabregas comes back and boom assist
####################
Just me who thinks Fernandinho could get longer than 3 games?
####################
You can thank us for that https://t.co/6X9hGqrztv
####################
Liooooooool https://t.co/ddpnWXF0Fs
####################
@SmashMkumla both deserve more than the Red card.. but I admired  fabregas for keeping his cool with another man's hand round his throat!
####################
#Chelsea scored all goals tonight ! #winning behavior #MCICHE shame in Aguero.

Anyone else dying to know what @cesc4official said to Fernandinho that drove him mental? #MCICHE

Filth from Aguero. Love watching pros lose their heads. Fernandinho is waiting for Fabregas in car park.
####################
@Chelsea_HQ That Navas dive will not be mentioned if anyone Chelsea did it people would be calling us cheats.
####################
@keoghmcfc I like Aguero fight, I thought Kevin d behaved like a petulant child, always moaning. City should have won
####################
I hope Cesc slapping Fernandinho gets picked up by the @FA. His retaliation was stupid, but Fabregas should face some punishment. #MCICHE
####################
I can't believe that was Aguero's first red card for City. How does such a dirty player get away with it so often?
####################
Brazil vs Argentina maybe https://t.co/y3hfqxDn75
####################
I haven't seen a keeper in the premier league as useless as Bravo. He does close to nothing in 90 mins and drinks goals effortlessly.
####################
Obviously https://t.co/ZTFCWJyPNd
####################
@LSN_Frantz the last few minutes got wild. Him and Fernandinho got reds
####################
@murtalaarz What a turnaround that was! Trailing at the break, goals from Diego Costa, sub Willian and Hazard secure a great 3-1 win.
####################
People need to calm down about Aguero. It's not as if he bit anyone
####################
Aguero wanted to add Luiz to the fallen Brazilians

@Rudd_A what??? Who pushed Fabregas??? Victim becoming culprit!!! Disgrace city players &amp; bigger disgrace their manager #bbcfootball
####################
Even Costa wouldn't do this type of shit, midget with eyes darker than the void. The man is a demon.
####################
My favourite game in absolutely ages, Costa is unplayable. Love how Luiz slyly winding up aguero the whole match until he couldn't hack it
####################
The good thing that costa wasn't on the pitch, otherwise he would get a red card too
####################
What are you saying? After being choked are trying to be funny or what? https://t.co/gbAoJLowYl

@ChrisN_H @GashThom Fernandinho as well for sure. I'd like to see what Cesc did haha
####################
@DezilDezz Cyber thugs on here really think what Fernandinho did was tough. He's going to miss a bunch of games during a crucial period.
####################
Forgot Cahill scored their goal, mans couldn't even get one for themselves smh
####################
That Aguero challenge was pure filth. Deliberate leg breaker. He and Fernandinho should see more than three match bans.
####################
Good win for Chelsea. Dirty challenge by Aguero and god knows what Fernandino was doing. Come on @LFC get those 3 points
####################
But fabregas slapped him first no one is talking about the provocation why? https://t.co/ZbatSnzp5d
####################
@DisasterKick Just like Costa. Bastard move, but the kind of guy you'd want to go to war with!
####################
Reclaimed victory and we're all the way up. #Luiz #Hazard #Moses #Conte #CFC
####################
Fernandinho should just have two footed Fabregas right in his neck
####################
Man city can't even complain. They failed to take their chances, Chelsea took theirs and Aguero lost his head
####################
@RuudGulled close, if only Gary Cahill wasn't such a nonce with the og
####################
Diego Costa is one striker u luv 2 have on ur side &amp; hope u never play against, for me he is D most complete striker in D #EPL
####################
Life without Aguero is not as bad as people thought. Glad I took a -4 to get Costa this week. #FPL
####################
Is it fair to call Aguero spineless for that tackle on Luiz @philmcnulty ?
####################
@matt__kean Not the reason you lost mate. Pretty disgraceful from Aguero at the end as well.
####################
Such a shame when good matches end like that. Aguero had been a scummer all match mocking Cahill etc, justice
####################
All Aguero was doing with that tackle was trying to get back into David Luiz pocket anyways #MUG
####################
Thank God he didn't take out a water bottle with that tackle could have been serious! #aguero
####################
Have to give it to Aguero though, that was some rugby tackle if his legs were arms

Fernandinho was about to go after Conte at the end. God knows what would've happened had he got his hands on him.

#CFC #MCICHE
####################
Cesc fabregas best performance of the match came at 97th minute , technically when the game is over #MCICHE
####################
Diego&gt;&gt;&gt; Aguero
Aguero bottled it again today. Can only score penalties &amp; against farmers
####################
Diego Costa brilliant. Petulance at the end of the game from aguero and Fernandinho has cost City 2 of their best players for no reason.
####################
On a serious note though, Chelsea are looking sharp, conte's got Luiz playing like an Italian, kante solid as ever, and pace going forward..
####################
Greatness lol https://t.co/J2UyhocEF8
####################
So happy now I got rid of Aguero for Costa last week. 

@FFPundits
####################
@ManCityArmy1894 annoyed me more that ferna and aguero got themselves sent off missing our important matches coming up
####################
Stupid challenge from Sergio out of frustration and if Fernandinho gets a red then Chalobah should as well, ref never had control of th game
####################
Son aguero was really like fuck you Luiz and drop kicks him
####################
@chalobah : I think Aguero will get a red card for this
savage @chalobah :naa bruh shove him to the ground. we don't play like that #MCICHE
####################
@johnhillsport awful tackle by Aguero yes but surely you are not putting them 2 incidents in same category !!
####################
So no Fernadinho and Aguero against Arsenal? Thank you @ChelseaFC .

We triumph still
####################
@Japonegro94 cahill csc , Costa - Willian - Hazard
####################
I don't like chelsea but conte has done alot in this team

Costa's aggression has been channeled into goal scoring and assists
####################
Screaming the house down when Hazard put the third in to end the game... standard.
####################
Luiz went to PSG to learn how to be a God level cheat from Thiago Silva. Came back to do bits with Costa and Hazard. https://t.co/I9VbvHluHn
####################
Costa best ST in the world currently
####################
YAASSSS! COME THROUGH FAM!: https://t.co/gCELrn4uAl
####################
Thank God he had left. Haha! #Mayhem https://t.co/gQrXks0FAJ
####################
Kante boutta fuck around and win two consecutive EPL titles. What a guy
####################
I  nearly did Dat o https://t.co/N9Pg1vpGS0
####################
Awful foul by Aguero,  I want to know if Fabregas said something...shameful reactions from #MCFC
####################
Kante boutta fuck around and win two consecutive EPL titles. What a guy
####################
@fernandinho  @aguerosergiokun , Good job .. I like that,
####################
Idk how Fabregas didn't do anything to Fernandinho when he was basically choking him
####################
@GaryJamesWriter he didn't cause the goals. Terrible defending by Otamendi for two goals.
Bravo is truly woeful in the art of goalkeeping
####################
@CynicalNegro we got aguero banned for the Arsenal game
####################
@Cussen91 @neilsherwin @ahmedyussuf10 Kun was embarassing there, but got no probs with someone trying to belt Fabregas
####################
Honestly though, imagine Aguero snapped Luiz's leg? All because City lost and Aguero was pathetic. It's horrible.
####################
YAASSSS! COME THROUGH FAM!: https://t.co/gCELrn4uAl
####################
@goldehaz kun is fucking shit, Yaya Gundo Silva is fine V arsenal
####################
Get punish from who? Pep ass licking @fa? https://t.co/giGCDfoZba
####################
In a match with 11 #Chelsea players on the pitch, who'd have bet on Sergio Aguero being the one to commit a heinous crime? #MCFC #CFC
####################
Thanks to Chelsea, aguero and fernando are not playing against us #MCFCvCFC
####################
Anybody got a vine or something of Aguero's challenge?
####################
I love how chelsea got a taste of their own violent medicine lol at least fabregas won't swallow water well for one week.
####################
@Smaxwell2981 yeah rescued a few points! Aguero totally lost the plot there, horrid challenge.
####################
Remember when people said Cesc is finished ?  man outplayed Kante today .. Absolute class display
####################
that Aguero challenge was stupid ! https://t.co/2twVkOp6eV
####################
@joe_weller_  Chelsea would be the exact same if it was reversed but there was still no nees for aguero`s tackle
####################
@realFutGod exactly. KDB and aguero are saving pep's ass and mourinho is already out of the race haha
####################
Proper Chels https://t.co/WiSSl1Y8FW
####################
MC cant even score in this game sampai cahill kena tolong sikit #MCICHE
####################
Clear #Aguero &amp; #Fernandinho just wanted Christmas off. Can't blame them really it's one way of getting a winter break.
####################
The only difference between that Aguero tackle and the Kevin Muscat tackle is that Luiz's legs ain't broken. Otherwise they are identical
####################
Fabregas stayed silent and behaved like a true Conte student. #CFC #MCICHE
####################
rate fabregas for not retaliating
####################
Fabregas the Christian
####################
Diego Costa and Dak Prescott are my heroes
####################
Kind of strange that Chalobah didn't see red even though Fernandinho did
####################
Actually that's Aguero's second violent conduct red of the season, so he's actually likely to get four games.
####################
Aguero tut tut happy days for chelsea!
####################
#FPL manager who had Aguero would be angry no goal and red card
####################
Chalobah, Batashuyi &amp; Fernandinho are about it
####################
@Billy_jones96 yeah fair. Fair play to fabregas for not reacting though
####################
The decision to go with Costa instead of Aguero as fantasy captain looks pretty good right now.
####################
That tackle from aguero is no laughing matter. That's fuckin disgusting. Should be sin died for tackles like that #joke
####################
Say what you want about #costa but that guy is a top draw baller. #MCICHE #Chelsea #MCFC #epl
####################
Should be at least 4 game ban. He wanted to break his bones. Just hit his ass instead. https://t.co/8M2Sm0E4ve

Aguero making me lose points in my #FPL Shd have at least scored one b4 deciding to cause a brawl #CitiSports @1realkunjoa_GH

@JoeTweedie almost looks like a scene from Matrix! Aguero flying!
####################
@Kesta30 18, Costa doing business again
####################
Fucking Aguero lost it sial
####################
@RobbieSavage8 can only describe Aguero as a coward after putting in a tackle like that
####################
FT Manchester City 1 - 3 Chelsea
Goal : G. Cahill 45'og D. Costa 60' Willian 70' E. Hazard 90'
####################
Anyone ever notice Hazard only scores in big games when Chelsea have the lead?
####################
#ManCityvsChelsea looks like  @aguerosergiokun and @fernandinho trying to catch #eddiejones eye #ENGvAUS
####################
What the fuck is Aguero doing ? Absolutely disgusting and could ended a career going through his knee like that , amateur
####################
Costa best ST in the Premier League
####################
Great start for my dreamteam today cahill og and aguero sent off!!! @Clairebair77 @Johnny_Buckley @romafox
####################
Just imagine for a minute if DIEGO Costa had made that attack on a player rather than Aguero.. they'd be calling for his execution
####################
@NidgePlays we fuckin need better defenders and WTF was bravo doing he could have at least tried harder

If Diego Costa did what Aguero did today, the whole football world would call for his head...
####################
@TheOddsBible Captaining Aguero instead of Costa is the kind of thing that drives a man to drink!
####################
Aguero should be banned he purposely kicked luiz for no reason.
####################
Not the first time Aguero done a challenge on Luiz like that.
####################
@kizzer_W this is the red https://t.co/2wdHYJ1dde
####################
finally, i have a reason to sold aguero.. LOL #FPL
####################
@richtaylz you prob think aguero had every right to do that tackle too. #antichelsea ref was poor, lost it themselves. Enough chances.
####################
@BossmanGeorgea and I think Fernandinho had a red card too
####################
God is Good. https://t.co/Xxp7qIEN62
####################
#aguero #mciche Aguero should have 5 game ban
####################
Fabregas slapped Fernandinho first
####################
"@TikiTakaConnor: Straight red card for Aguero &amp; Fernandinho. Both miss the game against Arsenal. @BeingHarnish

Aguero has badly let himself and  club down with that challenge, I doubt the manager will find that acceptable, he's not irreplaceable

####################
Because? Why? https://t.co/ylzsYVDHL6

Aguero had all intentions to end Luiz football career. It's clear as day he went for the kill. A strong message needs to be sent
####################
what a match #MCICHE #Hazard has a great game so did #Costa congrats #antonioconte
####################
I love Fernandinho
####################
Always said Argentines can't hack it under pressure (Aguero &amp; Messi)
####################
Feel costa has calmed down this season https://t.co/PMLddkRgBc
####################
@Zangola fabregas is clever he got him sent off he didn't react and walked into the boards , the replay will show it proper
####################
I think @fernandinho deserved two red cards for what he did to @cesc4official
####################
@nickinthe256 @laredarmy Slapped his arm down, more like it. After Fernandinho threw a punch.
####################
Fernandinho completely lost the run of himself - embarassing. When he sees replay of the tackle he'll realise how much of a d**k he was
####################
Sure! https://t.co/FOSFh1Hk39

Aguero trying to end Luiz career yet again!! Arrest that thug https://t.co/eOeAuiMAOT

He was going to join in the fight though https://t.co/fH3WRbm6iL

Over the moon that I 'uncaptained' Aguero. I'm fuming but how many are more angry than me? #MCICHE #FantasyFootball #fantasypremierleague
####################
Pep isn't at fault here tho, Let down by the players we had today. Bravo can never change my mind of him being a fraud
####################
Who's a better striker than costa in the bpl ? Aguero who ? Ibra who ?
####################
Lol......   straight win for any team that plays against them next week https://t.co/XpdfsQNLNr
####################
It was Alonso https://t.co/PUXUD8nsK2
####################
@SimonPeach I started him too but made Costa captain. Happy Kyle :)
####################
Fernandinho is honestly a cunt. Fabrics did nothing wrong to get strangled and pushed over an advertising board
####################
Watch how guardiola will get away with that! City an absolute disgrace! Not the first time aguero has two footed luiz either!
####################
Best moment is watching Fabregas turn and see the board, think to himself, hmm and then dive over.  #MCICHE
####################
Where does #Aguero 's hate for #Luiz originate from? #naughty #cfc #mcfc
####################
That tackle from Aguero is not just a 3 match ban. FA should take serious action. That is a career ending tackle which should be punished!
####################
@BlueCitizen007 do u still believe in fkin Bravo!!!

How stupid can Aguero and Fernandinho get to get two red cards in the end of the match.
####################
@MrJoshwahh @TSBible yeah also seen fernandinho push and grab Cesc by the throat deserved red card.

Think fabregas deserves a lot of credit for not reacting. Man city should be ashamed of those scenes

Perfect https://t.co/54Bu1vFpZt
####################
Aguero &amp; Fernandinho sent off, makes me feel slightly better about playing #MCFC next week! #LCFC
####################
@SirStiles007 I don't think Fabregas going over the advertising board helped either. Ithink Cesc tapping his face pushed him over the edge
####################
@premierleague What was wrong with fernandinho grabbing neck of cesc strict action needed by FA.

Aguero didn't do anything @NnamdiMichael3a

@sauceapples I would put it all on de Bruyne
####################
Aguero+Fernandinho simply lost it. Also interesting discussion to be had on another day about Guardiola conduct towards officials.
####################
Honestly think that Fernandinho will be the bigger loss. Iheanacho will step up.
####################
Aguero is a mother fucker.
That bitch doing it again and again
####################
I'd be tearing Anthony Taylor and Claudio Bravo a new one if I had access to internationally broadcast television
####################
@Gareth_ellis12 most of them if not all. Bravo is a massive liability, always got a mistake in him. That along with your shakey dfence is
####################
Man City doing their best to help Leicester out by having Aguero, Otamendi and Fernandinho suspended next weekend.
####################
@CaerdyddDevils I'm so glad someone else appreciates that joe ralls isn't the future Eden hazard as much as city fans like to make out

@koyero  dint u fabregas slap him??? U shld clearly rewatch dat scene again

GREAT RESULT AND WE TRIGGERED GUARDIOLA, FERNANDINHO AND AGUERO, WHAT A DAY!
####################
Never say this really as I've played the game myself but would be quite happy if aguero had snapped that big haired pricks leg in half
####################
Good thing I left aguero on my FPL bench. 
God knows.
####################
Ehya. I captained Costa https://t.co/DSqnY3eEht

Nah he'll get 3, it always seems like aguero comes back from injury or suspension when we play them https://t.co/KyW3QXW0Ow
####################
Aguero is disgraceful
####################
@terzmacd Fernandinho will get standard 3. Aguero standard 3 plus 1
####################
Bravo conceded all 3 shots on target. Waste
####################
Chalobah caused the mayhem.  He had no reason to push Aguero over, there was no mayhem until he did that.  Luiz was  ok seconds after

@Antony_DAngelo yeh, only injuries to him or hazard could halt them I guess
####################
@markaustinitv clinical,made City pay for De Bruyne miss, Costa &amp; Hazard 1st class today,what is it with other teams losing heads v Chelsea?
####################
City an absolute joke, aguero should be embarrassed, understand Fernandinho things get heated, sort it out pep fucking sort it out
####################
Chalobah deserves the captaincy after standing up for Luiz. Aguero and Fernandinho are fucking scumbags.
####################
Stadium ban For pep, 3 match bans for aguero, jail fernandino... @FA Please
####################
lol 25 points from costa and hazard &amp; -1 from aguero wtf
####################
Respect to Fabregas for displaying true sportsmanship
####################
Missed the game and read the commentary... did Fernandinho genuinely push Fabregas over an advertising hoarding!?
####################
@DeanMohan De Bruyne has to score. Jose woulda have lost it today if that was united. Pep cool head
####################
Actually let's not get excited about Aguero missing the Arsenal game cos Iheanacho will still murder us for bants

Hazard was deadly
####################
Lol. People saying Fabregas showed restraint. O jebi. Against Fernandinho? Eni aa le damu....

I'm actually angry at Aguero. If I were David Luiz I would've got straight up and in his face.
####################
Haha Fernandinho is a little fucker when he's pissed off!
####################
Aguero and Fernandinho conspiring to make a bad day even worse
####################
Patchtic! By #ManCity sore losses. Aguero should be banned 10 games for that. That was intent to hurt Luis. Won't see that in el classico.
####################
Honestly I loved Fabregas so much but now he's reaching Torres levels of bae.
####################
@FutbolRob_ he got slapped by Fabregas and then pushed him into a advertisement and he fell over
####################
@Jake_Woodside8 literally Aguero and Fernandinho both got red cards back to back with poor play smh, too bad Chelsea is on FIRE

@BC65biglad Luiz challenge, nope. Fabregas, nope &amp; for a barge? Fuck off. Deluded
####################
What is wrong with Aguero? Is it because Luiz is Brazilian or does he just not like him?
####################
Shit when you realise you have aguero in your fantasy football team and have to transfer him out!
####################
He will miss 3 city games skipper https://t.co/AOmpRLE7zb

But like Willian ein goal then Bravo make aboa bi finish
####################
Next week MCFC will be without Aguero, Ferndandinho and Otamendi (I believe) for the LCFC game. We helping out once again! Cheers.

####################
Mudah-mudahan ditambah QT @jonnysmiffy: That's a bad tackle from Aguero on Luiz and a red card. That's a four-game ban.
####################
3 game ban for Aguero and Fernandinho I guess .. 

Aguero after having a shocker does that- foolish, arrogance &amp; frustration! #MCFC
####################
@MatuMikey because it's fabregas of course he would say shit like this.

@_the12thman yes
that was assault by Aguero

@tashalouise6 My son has had a nightmare with his fantasy football team. First Cahill own goal and then Aguro off!
####################
#aguero should receive a lengthy ban for a challenge like that. Worthy of more than only 3.
####################
@TheM_L_G Though, Aguero ain't no angel. Indulges in fair few nibbles and gets away with it because doesn't seem like that sort of player.
####################
Chalobbah was booked. May be Fabregas will be banned https://t.co/q5c3TTNgyy
####################
Has to be a 3 match ban for Aguero too. Frustrated and lost his cool. Maradona in his blood.
####################
Aguero showing shades of Roy Keane but didn't even properly injure him ffs
####################
If Costa done that challenge it would be a 5 week suspension. Aguero will get the standard three.

Hazard with the dagger Gol... Great win @ChelseaFC
####################
was eating my lunch all innocently and then I look up at the tv to see fernandinho straggling fabregas, oh how lovely
####################
Hehe Fabregas reacted like a real football player #Respect
####################
Hahahahahahahahahahaha RT @prinzgbemi: Bravo can't even save a contact on his phone ffs
####################
You are finished at this level @fernandinho
####################
aguero has ruined fantasy for me cant forgive him for a few days
####################
@BBCBlueTuesday bravo is awful, should have saved at least 2 of their goals and stuck on his line for the 3rd awful signing
####################
Buzzing that aguero got sent off, will do a few people over on fpl hahahaha
####################
Aguero 5 matches, Fernandinho 10 matches. Disgraceful behaviour from a pathetic club.
####################
This man really hates David. I think this was 2011 https://t.co/Gm3i7IU9Op
####################
Let's see if Man City get punished for Fernandinho basically street fighting Fabregas on the pitch and Aguero's horrible tackle. Let's see.
####################
They all call him a scumbag but would cream themselves if he played for them. https://t.co/Gx4O6FY66y
####################
@ManCity not even joking, I feel twice as safe with @willy_caballero in the net. Bravo needs to just go and have a good look at himself.
####################
Disgusting tackle. https://t.co/y71aTJgOiq
####################
This guys are too much,,up chelsea,up hazard,Costa n Williams,,conte is d man...my blues for d league ....final score chelsea 3-city 1
####################
@AlbozsgZ02 Outrage, Aguero can't even back this behaviour up with his ability either. Needs to know his place
####################
Aguero and De bryne won the match for Chelsea
####################
Can't beat a bust up at the end of a game, especially when you're on the winning team. Disgraceful tackle by Aguero besides #MCICHE #PL
####################
@JoshMyatt1 no Fernandinho will get 6 or 7 it was disgraceful
####################
Shit https://t.co/snNQixVVAt
####################
Joe hart will hv saved Man City today. Navas is so ordinary. Nutin special
####################
Disgusting actions by City at the end of a great game. Say goodbye to Aguero and Fernandinho for a while.
####################
Can't wrong the manager for going with experience. https://t.co/XEe8hGCVTi
####################
&gt;aguero and fernandinho will miss the arselel match

my sides are gone
####################
When Costa gets angry he doesn't try to end a player's career, Should be a lengthy ban for that challenge
####################
Not the first time from Aguero. Disgraceful challenge. https://t.co/ER41xtpXtN
####################
Guardiola blanked Fabregas at the end there. Terrible refereeing by Taylor. Willian changed the game completely.
####################
Nope  https://t.co/44vpeg0NiK
####################
Surprise surprise Aguero will miss the goons game
####################
For Claudio Bravo anything on target is a goal. What a basket!!!
####################
Cesc handled himself well at the end considering Fernandinho was constantly pushing him by the neck.
####################
Ban Aguero for five games pls
####################
Dont know why I even argue with people from England, they're just mad joe hart got replaced by Bravo so they take anger out on him
####################
And Mr Bravo abi wetin be your name , baba you no even make any save
####################
Fabregas ban for the slap 1st? @premierleague I would of launched the little cunt into the stand, snake
####################
Yippee! https://t.co/5cucI2RW7k
####################
City will out of the title race by then without Aguero. https://t.co/FNrP3orkkk
####################
@KJMell Fabregas did fuck all to be fair
####################
Okay, today's positive start is declining. I've misplaced my headphones somewhere between here &amp; Halifax &amp; captained Aguero in fantasy footy
####################
Always Aguero on Luiz.
####################
Aguero needs to get his little bitch ass out of Luiz's pocket cuz he was embarrassing today.
####################
Boost:Aguero and Fernandinho out for arsenal game.
####################
@OsmanZtheGooner fucking pussyo fabregas. Wish fernandinho served him with a dirty right hook aswell
####################
So Aguero made me loose 6 points on PLF Gyimi f)
####################
Absolute disgusting challenge... Media would've gone mental if it was Diego Costa https://t.co/mqbmneG4gL
####################
@Chelseabible1 Just waiting on Aguero and Fernandinho to get their bans. Man City should be getting fined aswell.
####################
Ouch aguero and Fernandinho out for the arsenal match
####################
@KelechiKarma nobody said you had to dedicate to Kevin De Bruyne!
####################
@bateson87 fabregas booked so ref must have seen - therefore can't be banned? https://t.co/XFBnT9iKGC
####################
It's time I sell Aguero
####################
Fab should of headbutted Fernandinho TBH
####################
All going crazy between #MCICHE Fernandinho was a fool getting sent off as was Aguero.
####################
Fernandinho will be missed. The End.
####################
I've lost all respect for Aguero, I understand not liking someone. But that was studs to knee. Soft ground even worse. Absolutely absurd.
####################
Merry Christmas and Happy New year #Aguero,  see you in 2017 #MCICHE
####################
Courtois must have given her more money https://t.co/aNS0ywwQLY
####################
Aguero misses the arsenal game? https://t.co/RDIw0B1hJr
####################
@jingham27 3 lad and fernandinho
####################
@RachelRileyRR never mind their team, Aguero is my main man in my Dream Team
####################
Aguero bigger cunt than Costa
####################
Aguero out for the Arsenal game ffsss
####################
@TaylorTwellman Always loved Aguero, but players take form of manager &amp; I'd never have seen him do something that dirty b4 Pep.
####################
Aguero hates David Luiz, not the first time he tried to kill him looool
####################
@MufcinNews Look at the Culprit... https://t.co/xv0J3oBZwH
####################
A pulsating match at the Etihad sees Chelsea score all four goals as they come from an unfortunate Cahill own goal to annihilate city. #CFC
####################
lol fernandinho what you tryna do by holding fabregas' neck LOL
####################
He needs to be arrested and charged for attempted murder. https://t.co/38yVBsaOvc
####################
Aguero and Fernandinho will both be suspended for City v Arsenal, no? Next three games are Leicester, Watford...and then us.
####################
@SkyBet I bet Cahill first goal and 3-1 to Chelsea?? Why haven't I won??
####################
@JasmineGF being Kante today
####################
Three game for Aguero right?
####################
Annoying thing about today is tactics are fine. Aguero shite. De Bruyne needs to have a word with that miss. Otamendi not good enough
####################
Would rather he played against us man. Koscielny sabi handle am. https://t.co/uIm66Tripg
####################
@Mar_TheDreamer Costa woulda kill aguero right there yc :')
####################
@fernandinho your a disgrace to football @premierleague should suspended your wages absolutely disgrace to football
####################
Aguero and Fernandinho can both fuck off the pricks
Can't deal with the loss
####################
I remember Lineker calling Diego Costa a 'red card waiting to happen'. When was his last red? How many has Aguero had in that time? #CFC
####################
@101greatgoals where was Costa when Fabregas needed him?
####################
All these chances aguero was missing today. If it was against united he would scored all of them, bastard.
####################
One of the most horrendous tackles I've ever seen by Aguero. Both he and Fernandinho should (but won't) have the book thrown at them #CFC
####################
Best thing Aguero did in his life
####################
Thank you https://t.co/7L8Jr45wsn
####################
aguero will get a three game ban for a two footed knee high lunge on luiz and jose gets a three game ban for kicking a bottle into thin air!
####################
Serious issues. https://t.co/pEkwwkaeem
####################
Fabregas is an idiot, he probably said something
####################
The game clearly shows the difference between Conte and Pep , Costa and Kun , Hazard and DeBruyne !No much stupid comparison please #MCICHE
####################
Conte taking Costa off was a stroke of genius. He'd have definitely seen red at the end of that game knowing Costa.
####################
If Diego Costa stays healthy, Chelsea wins the league. No question.
####################
@sidcelery aguero out now on suspension,looking good.
####################
@NidgePlays bravo has been my favorite gk for two years and this is by far his worst form
####################
So does Aguero now miss our game too??? #AFC
####################
Aguero has lost his head this season
####################
Thanks to Aguero's implosion in the final minute he earned me -2 points for the game #MCICHE via @premierleague https://t.co/cFBuum3ejc
####################
Aguero and Fernandinho got their Christmas holidays
####################
Aguero will miss 4 games now, fernandinho will miss 3 !
####################
Oh dear Sergio,that will mean 3 game ban,Fernandinho  2 Games,not needed.
####################
Aguero will probably get a 6 game ban for that tackle
####################
If I am Gary Cahill, I will go Aguero and whisper to his ear. "Better to mistackle and score an own goal than an undisgrace tackle"...
####################
Aguero will recieve more than a three match ban for that, surely?
####################
What a great win for chelsea,but de bruyne and aguero cause the loss
####################
Hats off to Fabregas on keeping his cool &amp; not reacting to Fernandinho
####################
FT: Man City 1-3 Chelsea (45' Cahill o.g ; 57' Costa, 70' Willian, 90' Hazard) | Poss: 60%-40% | Shots: 12-9 #EPL
####################
@GADGritt thank fuck! Fancy us if we can get de bruyne out aswell
####################
So is Claudio Bravo only good against Argentina in big finals then? #Argentina #citychelsea
####################
Aguero &amp; Fernandinho to miss the
game vs Arsenal.
####################
You expect him to try fight with Fernandinho? You think he wants to get beaten up? https://t.co/6r52zZ58vJ
####################
Kept Firmino as my cap, Aguero as VC, but Bobby might not even play. So yeah https://t.co/Nwj8SWs3MS
####################
Everyone applauding fabregas for his "self control" and blatantly ignore the fact that he slapped fernandinho first. Condemn them both! #epl
####################
idk an aguero today. smh boi.
####################
I love it https://t.co/64PussWbyL
####################
Poor refeering decision there. Chalobah should have been sent off as well.. https://t.co/kFFvHLPPjc
####################
Rip in peace everyone who captained Aguero
####################
@LostLaker06 @MCFCworld no aguero booted the ball in front and was just edged out the way by luiz it wasn't a foul
####################
I think Fabregas would be banned at least 3 games
####################
@rylandscholes @ManCity Costa looks like monkey
####################
Fabregas slapped Fernandinho first
####################
@31ltolox we should have been out of sight, people just hate Bravo
####################
Or may be just a bad looser https://t.co/7y4CJphiz3
####################
@JamesHCard was disgusting, poor from Fernandinho as well. Proves why no one likes them
####################
Tank on the stage like Kante.
####################
Such as Arsenal. He scores against us every time. https://t.co/NIctiCxcgS
####################
Bravo, Otamendi and our defence are just not that good are they? #mcfc
####################
Aguero may be the best striker in the league but that tackle was fucking disgusting. Glad he's out for a few games.
####################
Honestly https://t.co/5ErPjDdhvh
####################
@dymczynski88 I've seen Aguero's challenge. Brutal
####################
So selfish from Aguero and Dinho. Idiotic
####################
@Lbrennan07 I'll Fernandinho you cunt
####################
Cesc slapped Fernandinho in the face, that's why the Brazilian reacted that way.
####################
Stupid fucking prick #aguero https://t.co/DflhTcMSbO
####################
that was familiar #Aguero https://t.co/zD0GbNkaKH
####################
@Wolf_Stack both yellows for fab and fernandinho.. where was a card for the player that pushed aguero ? Never a red for nando tho
####################
We just need Zouma back and in 100% form and fitness..... That's all!! Cahill needs to sit
####################
That's not the first time Aguero has done that to Luiz either. Dirty boy
####################
Took out Aguero a few weeks ago...didn't see this coming (red card) but saw the decline he was about to have... #CostaAllTheWay #FPL
####################
Aguero come through like a wrecking ball https://t.co/wdAecnYlcq

#Aguero is so cruel.....he should feel ashamed, he lacks character.
####################
Watch fabregas slap him fam https://t.co/TJtgBRaGhL
####################
Thank God Costa wasn't on the pitch!!
####################
City have Advance 1st half.. Atlast lost of pathetic last minutes redcards #aguero #fernandhino #MCICHE #1-3 #epl
####################
@andrew_farrell_ yeah, dirty tackle by Aguero, then City clears the bench and Fernandinho try to choke Fabregas and it was just wild
####################
Thank God Costa wasnt on the pitch when that fight broke, he would have been banned for the rest of the season #CostaCrimes
####################
Hazard is turning up. Not Kante https://t.co/HlXw3q6C6i
####################
Love ya man....he knows his football https://t.co/Q0lvsSa1fK

####################
Wait surely Aguero will be banned for City v Arsenal?
####################
He fraid big defenders https://t.co/H7WKBpUwyX
####################
The way Cesc goaded Fernandinho was the best moment of that game. Poetry in motion. Ended City today single handedly.
####################
Aguero - what a fucking cunt.
####################
Bromley: Julian Johnson Anderson Minshull Swaine Holland Martin Dymond Porter Cunnington Turgott (Wynter Chorley Higgs Prestedge Sho-Silva)
####################
Half expected Fernandinho to pull a chokeslam there.
####################
aguero missing at least liverpool and arsenal game hahahahaha #cunt
####################
Chalobah should have seen red too. Dunno what Fernandinho and Fabregas did.
####################
Cesc Fabregas should be given retrospective ban for calling @fernandinho a "nigger" @FA
####################
Any city fan who rates bravo kindly fuck off my timeline and delete your life
####################
It sas also so good to see Fabregas not reacting to Fernandinho's bullshit
####################
@oysteinwalle89 If worst comes to worst I'll just sit him out. He's an absolute categorical must own. No one else is taking Aguero's spot.
####################
No Fernandinho or Aguero vs Arsenal. Should I be happy or not? Pep probably won't be bothered anyway. We can't lose to them
####################
Retweeted Chelsea HQ (@Chelsea_HQ):

Aguero finally receives the red card he should have had in the Community... https://t.co/PYWQlILHBU
####################
Trust me Hazard is @Paedeezy he's the problem #MCICHE #KTBFFH @ChelseaFC
####################
Im scared of Diego Costa
####################
This Fernandinho is an animal #MCICHE
####################
@OfficialFPL should have made Costa my captain....
####################
I hope aguerro gets a long ban but as for Fabregas- what a fucking pussy. He fell over the advertising boards, wasn't pushed.
####################
@Mavryck_ Pedro still for me, Willian did his job tho ngl
####################
The honest reason why we've lacked clean sheets is because of bravo. He seriously needs to be replaced.
####################
Yur prediction ain't right dou. Bt still up chelsea https://t.co/XIPIJYxgjv
####################
Goodbye Sergio Aguero and hello Harry Kane (every #FPL manager)!
####################
The dream team league has been blown wide open.
#Aguero 

@JimmyClapton 
@DanDawson120
####################
If Aguero cared that much he had 92mins to show it, all good and well showing this passion after missing chances.
####################
@VbEH10 no aguero is good for city. You have put their season back on track
####################
very strong from Chelsea but if De Bruyne scores the open goal from 3 yards it's probably game over, small margins #MCICHE
####################
@TheManUtdWay Fabregas was looking for it but Aguero's was just an absolute twat of a tackle
####################
3 shots 3 goals. Thanks for coming out Bravo. Now go Fuck off back to Spain you shit bastard
####################
@mash_catchemall Fernandinho was a little grumpy haha
####################
City lucky Costa wasn't on the pitch
####################
Fabregas should have just pump fernandinho Sia
####################
While y'll are talking about Chelsea's performance, I'm thinking of Aguero and Fernandinho out of Arsenal match. https://t.co/32svZ13bgj
####################
@TrueGeordieNUFC Chelsea setting football back with that horrendous defensive play. If De Bruyne scores that tap in, it's a deserved loss
####################
if that was costa he'd get banned forever #MCICHE
####################
Also how stupid are Aguero and Fernandinho?They knew exactly what they were doing. This season has been frustrating but that's unacceptable
####################
Not the first time Aguero has done that to Luiz but glad he got the punishment he deserved. #ManCityvsChelsea
####################
What an absolute moron, #ArsenalFan https://t.co/vQzHAMZqMJ
####################
What a game ...Chelsea nailed it...
Pep still yet to win against Chelsea....hahahah
#chelsea #ManCity #ManCityvsChelsea #EPL #Hazard
####################
How bravo was barcelonas keeper I will never know, used to complain about joe but this guys something else.
####################
Aguero could be done for GBH tbh
####################
Sergio Aguero and Fernandinho misses Man City vs. Arsenal after receiving a red card in their game against Chelsea.
####################
@SizzleChest33 @Jay_Sanin gonna costa nother win if that happens again imo
####################
Ashley young dived once and everyone lost their minds. Aguero makes filthy cowardly tackles every year and no one bats an eye
####################
I would say something about how I predicted Aguero wouldn't turn up, but expecting Aguero to make the difference in a big game is stupid.
####################

Mad scenes at the end of that city game. Pep is now gonna lose 2 players for 3 games. Pleased aguero isn't in my fantasy football
####################
Bravo can not catch feelings sef
####################
@ManCity guardiola : if we have three fernandinho, so that's mean we play with eight players, so f****ng right.
####################
@aguerosergiokun @fernandinho all I  can say is thank you to you bread sellers
####################
@RyanTomes agreed...Fernandinho appeared as if he was breaking it all up then switched and went for Fabregas.
####################
@Damzsmxth Fabregas will probs get a ban then tbh
####################
@ben__taylor96 Hi Ben, it looks as though Chalobah &amp; Fabregas were carded in the incident at the end of the game.
####################
Anyone know the captaincy stats? What % captained Aguero this GW? #FPL
####################
De bruyne cannot even score against courtois. Neither goal nor girlfriend :")
####################
As soon as De Bruyne hit the bar you knew we'd win. It was in the air. 4 points clear!! #COYB #CFC

@AntonClarke1 played a blinder - eyeballed the hoardings, slid over them. It'll be Fernandinho having nightmares for being a stupid bastard.
####################
@Deckymch Fernandinho is a big cunt
####################
@crazymattman @bateson87 Aguero startede the whole thing you mug.
####################
That Aguero foul gets worse every time you see it
####################
@MrGeorgeBenson big ups to fabregas for not retaliating don't you think?  That went from 0-100 real quick and so unnecessarily
####################
@Doc_Joshi fabregas slapped fernandinho and then acted as if he'd done nothing
####################
Approx 87min Guardiola gesture to the ref. Shouldn't that be some games ban aswell? Mourinho haters. Aguero rest of the season.. hello? @fa
####################
@B_w84itVolschow David Luiz beat Aguero to a challenge and so he lunged at luiz wit both feet up like a flying tackle
####################
@mayankt_2 true pep is a sore loser and aguero will be banned for 3 at least
####################
would have been 0-3 if cahill hadn't scored an own goal, but its okay we're still on top!
####################
@Kieran_Dhadli Premier league refs and there fucking clueless, De Bruyne Miss of the season for sure if that goes in, different game
####################
Fabregas was on point!
####################
Fernandinho was just passionate, that's all
####################
And Aguero will be painted like a saint by the sporting media like always. Kmt
####################
if De Bruyne scores, city win, Hazards still a fraud. Funny old game
####################
Aguero should have attacked instead https://t.co/s0UmApENDe
####################
A fight between Chelsea and City where Costa is the one calming people down. Amazing.
####################
Hahahaha damn are you a wizard? https://t.co/qWMXyxBlCy

But what a win that. Hazard showed himself how to do it after that awful bit of unselfishness in the first half
####################
@Jian_M1n_Lim @premierleague https://t.co/3ZgTyBVLxv

he choking Fabregas throat only like 4 times nothing more
####################
@louis_fielding and Kolarov so minus another 1
####################
Sergio Aguero must have been watching some old videos of Terry Hurlock at his best.
####################
@FutboyJoey He slapped Fernandinho and then made sure he went over the hoarding when he could easily have stayed standing
####################
@Morganception Aguero should be getting a serious ban for that too
####################
I love Aguero, but hope he gets a serious ban for that. 

Put a downer on what was a great game.
####################
Aguero has let the club down today. No excuse for that challenge. #MCFC
####################
Hazard is no doubt the best player in the prem
####################
Job done. Hazard's doubles the Blues lead to round off a brilliant counter. #Chelsea #ManCity
####################
Aguero why didn't you think about all your fans who's captained you today on fantasy football you nause #fpl #ff #captain #-2
####################
Aguero should get more than a 3 match ban.
####################
Fuck off Aguero!!No sportsmanship at all! https://t.co/32lJ9hHdsh
####################
That Aguero lunge power assault on David Luiz was incredible. Like pushing the "deliberate foul" button on the old Fifa games
####################
5 match ban for aguero. Imagine if was Costa!!?? #citehfilth #FA
####################
If only fabregas was ibrahimovic for a second that fight could have been mad crazy
####################
aside from the assist, fabregas was kinda shit the whole game
####################
Imagine if Costa made that "tackle" &amp; not Aguero?! "Worst man in football ever" etc.....
####################
On league form alone Costa has been the best player in the world this season by a mile. Fucking beast
####################
@richardajkeys @beINSPORTS take a good clear look, fabregas slapped him first and said something that ticked off fernandinho.Still no excuse
####################
@jamesmaher99 easy to be clinical against us though, weakest defence in the top 10. Bravo?shite. Kolarov?shite. Stones?keeps getting caught
####################
Wtf aguero that's so dirty to do
####################
@philmcnulty for insulting @fernandinho fabregas is set free!
####################
Man city pulled a Tottenham against Chelsea last season. Poor tackle by aguero
####################
@dsimpson1989 @wil_i_amshaheed he did actually, you're right. He let Fernandinho hang himself
####################
Fair play chelsea won but aguero challenge disgarce and fernandinho lost his head #Manche (liverpool fan)
####################
Fernandinho tried to choke my man. This isn't porn, this is football. Take action. @FA https://t.co/NkYmZTfVus
####################
Would need to be 5 game bans for Aguero and Fernandinho to miss the match against #LFC. Possible.

@petr_hruby Yep smh, racist fan add. Aguero is a confirmed hothead there's no more denying ffs

Lool did fernandinho just start going at fabregas? Fabregas gave him a cheeky slap and that provoked him
####################
Kante is the most average player if ever seen ntn special but his Running is brilliant
####################
@jameswyatt3212 not Aguero, his was just a bad tackle, he didn't get involved in the fighting rubbish but Fernandinho definitely.
####################
We'll go with a 4-3-3 without Aguero. His loss won't be that bad. It's Ferna that stings. You can't replace him
####################
Sorry but KDB is the real bottler today. Aguero a close second. Game could have been wrapped up in an hour. Shocking.
####################
Aguero been reading Roy Keane's guide to tackling?
####################
Chelsea is a problem this year https://t.co/47aIrq933g
####################
@mrscassw I didn't panic when Cahill OG'd, Aguero is a cunt, and Pep bringing his simulation tactics to City! We were phenomenal 2nd half!
####################
WHY DID FERNANDINHO HAVE HIS HAND AROUND CESC'S NECK?!
####################
Obviously not including the Aguero tackle which was abhorrent and he should be given a long ban for that 'tackle'

@DJRUSSKE @Fredszzzx yeah Fabregas started it then Fernandinho lost it you can't be getting slapped up in a game
